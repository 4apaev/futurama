It was originally broadcast on March 28, 1999. The episode introduced pizza delivery boy, [[Fry]] and the story of how he came to the year [[3000]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:SpacePilot3000.png|thumb|left|Fry in the Cryogenics tube]]\n\nOn December 31, 1999, pizza delivery boy Philip J. Fry is playing the video game Monkey Fracas, Jr. He loses the game and is then sent out to his next delivery at [[Applied Cryogenics]]. On his way, he sees his girlfriend [[Michelle]] in a cab with another man, [[Constantine]]. Michelle, proclaiming she's left his stuff on the side-walk, speeds away with Constantine. Fry keeps riding his bike, saying, &quot;I hate my life. I hate my life.&quot; He makes it into the lab where a guy outside says, &quot;Happy New Year!&quot; and rides away on Fry's bike. Upon arriving at the Cryogenics chamber and trying to find [[I.C. Weiner]], the pizza's intended recipient, Fry realises he's been duped and was sent on a prank delivery. Sitting down in a chair, he balances onto its back legs, cracks open a beer and says, &quot;Here's to another lousy millennium.&quot; The entire world is counting down to one on New Year's Eve and as the countdown hits &quot;one&quot;, Fry blows a Party Horn to celebrate the new millennium. The party horn makes him lose his balance, he falls back and lands in one of the empty [[cryogenics]] tubes. The freezer freezes Fry and he is frozen and stuck there for 1000 years. Over the course of the next thousand years, the world is repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt by invading aliens as Fry waits in stasis.\n\nWith a ping, Fry is released from his cryochamber and wakes up on New Year's Eve in the year [[2999]]. With a shock he realises he is in the future and laments the loss of his family and friends but quickly dismisses his sadness with a loud &quot;YA-HOO!&quot; [[Terry]], a worker at Applied Cryogenics welcomes him &quot;to the world of tomorrow!&quot;. Fry is escorted to the Fate Assignment Officer's Office where he meets [[Leela]], a beautiful woman with a huge eye in the center of her face, who explains that it is December 31, 2999. Talking things through with Leela, Fry confesses that the 20th century didn't hold anything for him and he feels optimistic about the future. After an encounter/examination with the Probulator, a DNA scan reveals that he has only one living relative in this time period: his many times great nephew [[Professor Hubert Farnsworth]].\n\nFry starts to make himself a promise that with his &quot;second chance&quot; he's going to make the most of his life and not mess things up again. A menacing chime brings him out of his reverie as Leela reveals she's found him his permanent career assignment; delivery boy. Fry begs for any other job but Leela says that everyone, even herself, has to do a job whether they like it or not, citing that in the future '&quot;You gotta do what you gotta do&quot;'. She tries to implant a [[Career chip|chip]] that will label Fry a delivery boy forever, but Fry runs away. Giving chase, Leela ends up falling into one of the cryogenic tubes, which sets itself for 1000 years much like Fry's tube. Fry then to leaves her to be frozen there but, out of the goodness of his heart, decides to reset the tube to thaw in 5 minutes, says &quot;You owe me one.&quot; and leaves the lab.\n\n[[File:Frybenderbooth.jpg|thumb|Fry and Bender in the suicide booth.]]\nWalking around [[New New York]] city and seeing how much it has changed, he decides to call his descendant Farnsworth. He gets in line for what he thinks is a phone booth and meets [[Bender]] waiting in line. It turns out the phone booth is actually a [[suicide booth]], and that Bender is eagerly awaiting his death. After accidentally activating the machine, Fry pushes Bender to the other side of the booth and they survive.\n\nHaving failed at killing himself again, Bender invites Fry to get drunk with him at a bar. Meanwhile, Leela's stasis chamber is timed out and she is unfrozen, Terry again appearing and being told to shut up. After being yelled at by her boss for losing Fry, Leela is forced to continue her pursuit of Fry. Fry finds out that Bender wants to kill himself because of his programming as a girder-bender for suicide booths. Fry convinces Bender to abandon his plans of suicide and the two become friends. Leela spots them inside O'Zorgnax's bar and after requesting backup, chases them into the [[Head Museum|head museum]] where Fry encounters the head of [[Leonard Nimoy's head|Leonard Nimoy]]. Fry asks Nimoy to do &quot;the thing&quot; but being a head in a jar, naturally he can't. Leela catches up with them and Fry and Bender run for it but knock over the shelves, on which sat Richard Nixon's jar, which breaks. The backup Leela requested earlier arrives and they start beating up Fry. Leela sees the officers are out of control and helps get them off Fry. Hiding in the back room of the museum, Bender's programming is accidentally reset when he needs to bend some bars to aid their escape.\n\nBender and Fry run into the ruins of [[Old New York]], where Fry has a flashback of dancing with Michelle on their first date. The memories of Fry and Michelle dancing fade into a two finned beast which bursts out the now-frozen ice. After realising that everyone he knows is gone, Bender points out that he can see someone Fry knows; Leela has found them. Giving in, Fry resigns himself to becoming a delivery boy and readies himself to have his [[career chip]] implanted but Leela instead removes hers and declares she's quitting.\n\nThey finally track down Professor Farnsworth, who clarifies that Fry is indeed his uncle. After being given a tour of [[Planet Express]], his delivery company, all four are shocked as the police knock on the door having tracked them down. They plan to get away on the [[Planet Express ship|ship]] at the same time as the world counts down to the year 3000. As they prepare to take off the police have a cannon aimed at the [[Planet Express building]], ready to fire at them should they try to take off. As the take-off countdown and the world countdown both reach zero, they blast off under the cover of fireworks celebrating the new millennium.\n\nFry, Leela and Bender realise they're all fugitives as they now no longer have career chips. Professor Farnsworth reveals he has kept the career chips from his old crew and invites them to join his company. When Fry asks what his job title will be, Farnsworth tells him his job is to transport the cargo safely to its destination. Fry clarifies that he's a delivery boy, which Farnsworth confirms. Overjoyed with his new job, the Planet Express ship flies off into the cosmos.\n\n== External Links ==\n[http://www.megacartoons.net/cartoons/1263/space-pilot-3000 Space Pilot 3000]{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}[[pl:]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 1]]"

It originally aired in North America on April 4, 1999.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Professor Farnsworth]] introduces his new crew, [[Fry]], [[Leela]] and [[Bender]], to the othеr [[Planet Express]] employees - [[Hermes Conrad]], the bureaucrat; [[Amy Wong]], the Chinese intern whose super-rich parents own half of [[Mars]]; and [[Dr. Zoidberg]], the staff doctor who knows nothing about humans.\n\nAfterward, the crew go on their first delivery, with Amy accompanying them. It's only to the [[Moon]], nothing special, but to Fry, this is a dream come true. They get to the moon and Fry discovers that there is an amusement park there. The delivery is a crate of stuffed toys for one of the amusement games, and once that is delivered the crew explores [[Luna Park]].\n\nAmy discovers she accidentally left the keys to the ship with the crate, and they are now in the claw game. She tries to get them back before Leela (who has been appointed captain of the ship) finds out, but she is not very good with the claw and keeps dropping the keys. Bender tries putting his arm through the game to grab the keys but gets caught and is thrown out of the park.\n[[File:TheSerieshaslanded.jpg|left|thumb|On the Luna Rover]]\nFry gets bored of the park and wants to explore &quot;the real Moon&quot;, and find the site of the first lunar landing which has been lost for more than a thousand years. He and Leela hijack a cart and go exploring, but soon their oxygen runs out and they have to go to a Moon [[Farmer]] to get some more. He only lets them have some if they do some chores for him. While doing chores Fry and Leela discover Bender has been trying to romance the farmer's three robot daughters; [[Lulubelle 7]], [[Daisy-Mae 128K]] and [[The Crushinator]]. The angry farmer chases Bender off with a shotgun.\n[[File:Fryonthemoon.png|thumb|''&quot;Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.&quot;'']]\nFry and Leela, now with more oxygen, manage to escape and find the lunar lander, where Leela tells Fry off for getting them into this situation, all because he wanted to see the Moon. Fry apologizes and says it was his dream. Leela looks out of the lander window and sees the Earth from space, and realizes what Fry meant, and forgives him. Next thing they know, they see Bender, running away from the farmer, who is attempting to mow him down with a giant combine harvester. Luckily for the crew, Amy, after much practice at the claw game, picks up the lander and Bender with a magnet attached to the Planet Express ship and they all fly back to Earth.\n\n==Themes==\nIn this episode, Bender reveals his lifelong dream of being a folk singer, a theme that is revisited in future episodes, especially ''Bendin' in the Wind'' in Season 3 and ''Forty Percent Leadbelly'' in Season 9.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[pl:]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Series Has Landed, The}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 1]]"

It originally aired in North America on April 7, 1999. The episode was written by [[Eric Horsted]] and directed by [[Bret Haaland]]. The plot focuses on [[Fry]] and [[Bender]]'s search for an apartment after deciding to become roommates and the various difficulties they have in finding a place that is acceptable to both of them.\n\n== Plot ==\nSince his arrival in the future, [[Fry]] has been living in the [[Planet Express]] offices, and due to this, Hermes arranges an immediate agenda meeting regarding their workplace's conditions: his habits of eating everything, attracting owls with crumbs, using the chemical burn shower irresponsibly and drying his hair with the [[Planet Express ship]]'s engines, giving him huge doses of radiation at the cost of throwing off the calibration of their output, making it known that [[Fry]]'s presence is disrupting business. When the group comes to talk with [[Professor Farnsworth]] about [[Fry]]'s living arrangements, the last straw is cut when Fry eats the Professor's alien mummy of Emperor Nimbala- who is noted to taste like beef jerky- and is utterly upset as it was he who was going to eat him. Due to the events of this morning, it is decided that [[Fry]] has to go. After being physically removed from the office, [[Fry]] decides to move in with [[Bender]].\n\nSeveral days later, [[Fry]] discovers that he can't take living in [[Bender]]'s 2 cubic meter [[Apartment 00100100|apartment]], and the two begin a search for living space that will satisfy them both. But ultimately, they are unsuccessful until one of [[Professor Farnsworth]]'s colleagues dies. [[Fry]] and [[Bender]] lease his old apartment, with [[Bender]] living in the closet.\n\n[[File:SoberBender.jpg|thumb|left|''&quot;Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself, then for the people who love you.&quot;'']]At the house warming party - [[Leela]] gives [[Fry]] a mini fruit tree, [[Dr. Zoidberg]] brings caviar and [[Professor Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] gives him a teriyaki style mummy - they watch [[All My Circuits]], and each time [[Bender]] is in the room, the television doesn't work. [[Bender]] gets the landlord, and after four failed attempts to find the cause the landlord finally finds the cause, [[Bender]]'s antenna.\n\nAfter discovering his antenna interferes with the building's televisions, [[Bender]] is forced to relocate back to his old residence, but [[Fry]] stays put. Distraught at the separation from his friend, [[Bender]] goes on a self-destructive sobriety binge, eventually cutting off his own antenna to live with [[Fry]].\n\nOut of concern for [[Bender]], [[Fry]] moves back into [[Bender]]'s old apartment (after recovering [[Bender]]'s antenna). Then discovers that [[Bender]]'s over-sized closet (bigger than a human sized bedroom) has more than enough room for a human to live comfortably.\n\n==Themes==\nThe Professor makes his first reference to news, but it's &quot;sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news&quot; in this episode. Bender says &quot;Fun on a bun&quot; for the first time.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 1]]"

Inform the men.|Zapp Brannigan}}\n'''Love's Labours Lost in Space''' is the fourth episode of production [[:Category:Season One|Season One]] and the fourth [[Season 1 (broadcast)|broadcast]] episode of ''[[Futurama]]''. It originally aired in North America on April 11, 1999. The episode was written by Brian Kelley and directed by Brian Sheesley. This episode introduces the recurring character [[Zapp Brannigan]] when he attempts to prevent the Planet Express crew from completing their mission. It also introduces [[Nibbler]], whom [[Leela]] adopts as a pet.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt by [[Amy]] to introduce Leela to eligible bachelors at [[The Hip Joint]], a [[New New York]] nightclub, the crew gets sent on a tax-deductible charity mission. The uninhabited planet [[Vergon 6]] has been mined hollow for [[2972|more than 25 years]], and is about to collapse. The crew is sent to recover two of each kind of animal native to the planet for breeding purposes.\n\nUnfortunately, Vergon 6 has been declared restricted due to its undeveloped status, under [[Brannigan's Law]]. The Planet Express crew are arrested by the legendary space captain Zapp Brannigan, who immediately attempts to seduce Leela. Leela initially rebuffs Brannigan, but eventually succumbs to pity for the desperate fool, a fact that Brannigan brings up in every later appearance in the series.\n\nThe sexually-satisfied Brannigan allows the Planet Express crew to depart for Vergon 6, and the crew proceed to collect the strange animals. While working on their checklist, they discover a small black and white creature with a third eye on a stalk. Leela decides to rescue it as well, names it [[Nibbler]], and places it in the cargo hold with the other animals. When [[Fry]], Leela, and [[Bender]] return with the last animal, they discover that the mystery creature has devoured all the other animals.\n\nThe planet begins to collapse, and when the crew try to escape, they discover that the ship is out of fuel. Leela refuses to beg Zapp Brannigan for assistance, and the crew settle in for their inevitable deaths. The ship shifts to one side, and the crew discovers that Nibbler has defecated a small pellet of [[dark matter]], which is the fuel the ship runs on. Bender tosses the ultra-dense pellet into the engine, and the crew returns safely to Earth.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nLeela is looking for a date and shows no interest in Fry. Fry has sex with the [[21st century woman|21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century woman]] he meets at The Hip Joint. The episode introduces the Brannigan-Leela plotpoint, which is used in later episodes in the series such as [[A Flight to Remember]] and [[War is the H-Word]].\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 1]]"

It originally aired in North America on April 18, 1999.\n\n== Plot ==\nWhile attending a [[New New York Yankees]] [[blernsball]] game at [[Madison Cube Garden]], [[Fry]] is told by [[Leela]] that Blernsball is a &quot;jazzed up&quot; version of baseball. [[Bender]] is offended that humans won't let robots compete in the blernsball league. [[Hermes]] calls the crew to report back to the office for a delivery mission. The delivery is to [[Chapek 9]], a planet inhabited by human-hating robot separatists who kill humans on sight, so Bender is assigned the duty of performing the actual delivery. Bender claims that it is a robot-religious holiday, ''Robanukah'', and doesn't have to work. Despite his made-up holiday, Bender must go on the mission.\n\nUpon arriving at the planet, a resentful Bender is lowered to the surface using the ship's winch. Fry and Leela decide to throw a [[Robanukah]] party for Bender to show their appreciation. They receive a rushed message from Bender, who has been captured by the robot separatists when they found out he worked for humans. In order to avoid being killed on sight, Fry and Leela disguise themselves as robots, and infiltrate the robot society.\n\nAfter hiding out in a robot movie theater, Fry and Leela blend in with the crowd at the opening ceremonies of the daily human hunt. There they discover Bender is alive and playing the robots' prejudice for his own benefit, claiming he has killed a million billion humans on Earth.\n\nFry and Leela reunite with Bender during the hunt in an abandoned robot porn shop, but he refuses their offer of rescue. Before Fry and Leela can leave, the other robots arrive and they are placed on trial for being human. After being sentenced to a life of tedious robot-type labor by [[Computer Judge]], they are dropped through a trap door, where they meet the five [[Robot Elders]]. The Robot Elders reveal that the trial was for entertainment, and command Bender to kill Fry and Leela with a device called ''The Ceremonial Killamagig'', but he refuses. The Robot Elders reveal that humans are just being used as a scapegoat to distract the population from the actual problems; lug nut shortages and the incompetent corrupt government of Robot Elders, and that many of the supposed powers humans have that robots fear are in fact made up. The Robot Elders decide to kill the three, citing that they know too much. Fry threatens to breathe fire on the robot elders, throwing them into a state of confusion on whether humans can do that or if that was something that they themselves made up. The crew escapes, and is pursued by a horde of robots. As the crew escapes on the winch, the robots stack on top of each other to capture the crew. Bender remembers that he never actually delivered the package, and puts it into the hands of the robot on top. The unbalanced tower and the package falls to the ground, and the robots are showered in much-needed lug nuts, and renounce their human-hating ways. The crew, now en route back to Earth, celebrate ''Robanukah'' with Bender.\n\n==Themes==\nThe Professor begins his delivery pitch with, &quot;Good news, Everyone.&quot;{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 1]]"

Unable to pay the bail, Fry remembers he had a bank account back in thе twentieth century; he remembers his PIN number, and casually mentions the fact that the PIN number was similar to the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda at the pizza restaurant he worked at before he was frozen. Surprisingly, his old bank account is still active and has been accruing interest for the past thousand years, bringing the balance from 93 cents to $4.3 billion dollars. Fry goes on a massive spending spree. He buys numerous 20th century artifacts, such as [[Wikipedia:Ted Danson|Ted Danson]]'s skeleton, an antique robot toy for Bender, and the last known tin of now-extinct anchovies, which were fished to extinction shortly after the [[Decapodian]] people arrived on Earth. [[Zoidberg]] breaks down crying, &quot;We kept saying 'one more can't hurt' and then they were gone. We're sorry!&quot;\n[[File:Afishfulofdollars.jpg|thumb|left|Mom and her sons]]\n[[Mom]], famous industrialist and owner of ''Mom's Friendly Robot Company'', whose main product is ''Mom's Old-Fashioned Robot Oil'', wants to secure the anchovies for her own purposes. Anchovy oil could be used to permanently lubricate robots, and therefore represent an enormous threat to Mom's business interests if the remaining anchovies were cloned. Mom uses ''Mom's Old Fashioned Video Friendly Surveillance Unit'' to spy on Fry and overhear the clue to his number.\n\nMom's sons [[Walt]], [[Larry]], and [[Ignar]] conspire with [[Pamela Anderson's head]] to steal Fry's ATM card and PIN (the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda), by tranquilizing him and making him wake up in an environment similar to the 20th century. They get Pamela Anderson to order a cheese pizza and a large soda, and Fry tells her the price. Now that they have his PIN they can bankrupt Fry. All of Fry's 20th century artifacts are repossessed, except the anchovies, which Fry had hidden in his sock.\n\n[[File:-A Fishful of Dollars.jpg|thumb|Anchovy Pizza]]\nMom arrives at Planet Express and offers to buy the anchovies to help Fry recoup some of his losses. However, when Fry declares that he intends to eat the anchovies, she stops interfering and gently encourages him to consume all of them in order to destroy the threat to her business. Fry covers a pizza with the anchovies, and shares them with the rest of the Planet Express employees. Everyone except Fry spits their pizza out in disgust. Fry claims that they are an acquired taste. When Zoidberg enters the room, he smells a 'heavenly stench' and immediately devours all the remaining anchovy-covered pizza, and goes on a rampage screaming &quot;MORE! MORE!

It originally aired in North America on May 2, 1999.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Bender]] is watching a cooking show with [[Neptunian]] TV chef [[Elzar]], when [[Leela]] and [[Fry]] walk in on him. Quickly, he tries to turn it off but Leela turns in back on again. Bender then admits that he likes to cook but was to embarrased to tell it to anyone.\n\n[[Hermes Conrad]] threatens to cut Bender's salary, since Bender has no official duties at [[Planet Express]] except sitting on the couch watching the cooking shows all day, something he wanted to keep to himself. \n\nInspired by the Neptunian TV chef Elzar, Bender decides to take on the job as the ship's cook. He, Fry and Leela go to shop for ingredients in [[Little Neptune]]. While Bender is buying a [[Neptunian slug]], Fry tries to get his lungs replaced with gills by an organ seller. Just as the seller was about to do unsafe surgery, Leela interrupts the transaction, knocking out the dealer and his crony. She berates Fry afterward for his reckless behavior. Professor [[Farnsworth]] then sends the crew off on a delivery to the planet [[Trisol]], a mysterious world in the depths of the Forbidden Zone in the Galaxy of Terror. Leela claims that the scary names are a false conception of the galaxy. Bender serves the crew a meal of almost completely of salty Neptune slug and salted water.\n\nAfter the ship lands, Fry is assigned the task of making the delivery trek across the desert under the planet's three blazing suns. When he arrives at his destination, the [[Trisolian]] palace, he finds it empty. Stricken with thirst, he grabs a bottle of blue liquid that is sitting on the throne and drinks it. Armed Trisolians, who are revealed to be liquid-based organisms, storm the throne room, revealing that the bottle Fry drank actually contained the emperor [[Bont|Bont the Viscous]]. Rather than being punished, Fry is declared the new emperor. Shortly afterward, he opens the package that he was delivering, to reveal a &quot;Please don't drink the Emperor&quot; sign. Ironically, Fry declares that the package arrived just in time.\n\n[[File:Mythreesuns.jpg|thumb|left|A failed assassination]]\nAfter being found by the crew, Fry chooses Bender as his new prime minister. The high priest [[Merg]] informs Fry that as part of the coronation, Fry will have to recite the royal oath which consists mainly of a very, very long list of emperors, in the order that they killed each other from memory, on pain of death if he makes a mistake. During the pre-coronation party, Leela informs Fry that the average reign of a Trisolian emperor is only one week, as whoever &quot;drinks&quot; the old emperor is declared the new one. When Fry refuses to listen to her warning, Leela returns to the ship, vowing not to help Fry again. Fry, apparently aware he cannot be drunk because he is solid, ignores this.\n\nAt the coronation, Fry recites the oath properly, and is sworn in as Fry the Solid. As the suns set, the Trisolians begin to glow - including the alive-and-well emperor Bont from inside Fry's stomach. Bont demands that Fry be cut open and drained.\n\nThe crew takes refuge in the throne room, and tries to work out a way to extract the emperor without killing Fry. Bender calls Leela on Fry's behalf, but gets an inconclusive response. She has to fight her way past Trisolian forces in order to reach the palace. Bender sees what is happening and decides to exploit the situation: He lies to Fry by saying that Leela is dead. This prevarication saddens Fry so profoundly that he begins sobbing, though slowly. After Leela arrives, she begins beating Fry, causing him to weep in pain, extracting the emperor. Once he is out, the emperor beats Fry up, taking turns with the other crew members, and thanks him. With the emperor safely outside Fry's body, the crew is allowed to leave.\n\n=== Gadgets &amp; Inventions ===\n*Robot Wash\n*Genetically enhanced eggplant with yolks\n*Fish gill implants\n\n== Alienese ==\n*One of the &quot;Do Not Drink the Emperor&quot; signs is in [[Alienese]].\n\n==Themes==\nIn this episode it is revealed that Bender enjoys cooking, a theme that is revisited in future episodes, and featured in &quot;[[The 30% Iron Chef]]&quot;.

It originally aired in North America on May 9, 1999.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Professor Farnsworth]] announces that tomorrow the crew will make a delivery to [[Ebola 9]], the virus planet. They cannot go today, because he wants them all to be alive for the [[Academy of Inventors]] annual symposium, where he will present the [[Deathclock]], a device which calculates how long a person has left to live. At the symposium, he meets a former student of his from [[Mars University]], Professor [[Ogden Wernstrom]], who vowed revenge on the Professor after receiving an A-minus on a pop quiz, even if it took him a hundred years. Just over ninety-nine years have passed, and no revenge is in sight; so Farnsworth considers himself to be in the clear.\n\nWernstrom presents his invention, an apparatus that allows fish to breathe water, but travel on land, known as the [[Reverse Scuba Suit]]. He taunts Farnsworth over his invention from the previous year — the [[Deathclock]]. Mortified that he had already presented the invention and forgotten about it, Farnsworth hastily begins drawing on a napkin, and comes up with the [[Smell-O-Scope]], a device that allows people to smell distant cosmic objects. The Smell-O-Scope is received with scorn and laughter, and Wernstrom gives it &quot;the worst grade imaginable—an A minus minus&quot;.\n\nBack at [[Planet Express]], he invites everybody to see the Smell-O-Scope that he built last year and also forgot about. Fry begins pointing the Smell-O-Scope around, and discovers the smelliest object in the universe. After calculating its path, Professor Farnsworth announces that the object will collide with [[New New York City]] in 72 hours. After some research, a video found on the internet reveals the object to be a [[Giant Garbage Ball|giant ball of New York City's garbage]] launched via mob-obtained rocket into space around [[2052]] in an attempt to alleviate a crippling rubbish problem.\n[[File:Now Boarding Spaceship.jpg|thumb|right|The Planet Express crew, on their mission to the garbage ball.]]\nAfter warning the mayor of [[New New York]], [[Mayor Poopenmayer]], a plan is hatched to destroy the garbage ball. The [[Planet Express Crew]] is sent on a mission to plant a bomb on a fault line on the ball. The bomb has been set to allow twenty-five minutes to escape. When the crew lands on the ball, Fry is amazed of all of the 20th–century items on the ball; but Leela reminds Fry that these things were garbage, which is why they are in the garbage ball in the first place. Unfortunately, the Professor put the bomb's countdown display in upside down, and it actually only allows fifty-two seconds. The crew panics, and Bender throws the bomb into space to save themselves, but runs into a small meteor and falls back to the surface; and Bender throws it again. The opportunity to destroy the garbage ball is lost, so the crew returns to [[Earth]] in shame.\n\nAttempting to find another way to save the city, the Mayor sends in Wernstrom to find a way to stop the garbage ball. Wernstrom demands tenure, a grant and five research assistants. He has no plan, but declares that he is set for life and leaves. In a last-ditch effort to redeem himself, Farnsworth comes up with a second plan to save the city: to launch a second ball of garbage to bounce against the first one to send it flying into the sun. The Mayor exclaims that there hasn't been garbage in New New York for 500 years, so Fry demonstrates how to make garbage. An announcement is made to tell the city to not throw away its garbage. The city of New New York quickly generates a second ball of garbage, which is fired at the first garbage ball. The rocket flies into the air and hits the other garbage ball head-on. The second ball of garbage flies out of the solar system and the other flies into the sun. Leela's concerns that the new garbage ball will return and destroy a future generation are dismissed by other characters. Fry says that it won't be for hundreds of years. The city then confiscates Wernstrom's award to give to Farnsworth, who swears revenge against the Professor once again.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Big Piece of Garbage, A}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 1]]"

It originally aired in North America on May 16, 1999. The episode guest stars [[Adam Horovitz]] and [[Mike D]] as [[Beastie Boys' heads|themselves]], and [[Dan Castellaneta]], famous for his role as Homer Simpson on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, another show Matt Groening created; as the [[Robot Devil]].\n\nThe episode explores the various degrees to which humanity tends to regard &quot;religion&quot; by following [[Bender]], a robot. The episode was featured in the ''Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection'' DVD box set, and received positive reviews by critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story begins with [[Fry]], [[Leela]], and [[Bender]] at a [[Beastie Boys' heads]] concert, where they are invited backstage afterward by an old acquaintance of Bender's, [[Fender]]. While meeting the Beastie Boys, Bender and Fender ditch the &quot;organ sacks&quot; and Bender is introduced to &quot;[[Robot#Jacking-On|jacking-on]]&quot;, the dangerous abuse of electricity.\n\nSoon Bender's dabbling becomes a full blown addiction to electricity, and he resorts to desperate measures to get his fixes (such as forcing the Planet Express Ship to fly through an electrical storm). After hitting rock bottom, Bender realizes he has a problem and turns to religion for help; joining the Temple of Robotology. He is then baptized in oil and has Robotology's symbol welded onto his chest by [[Reverend Lionel Preacherbot]].\n\nWhile the rest of the [[Planet Express crew]] is initially happy that Bender has given up his addiction, they quickly find the new Bender tiresome, and try to bring out their friend's old personality by taking him to [[Atlantic City]] and reintroducing him to vice. They succeeded in bringing about the old Bender back, but were unaware that the contract of Robotology stipulates that if Bender sins, he is sent to [[Robot Hell]] for all eternity, and soon the [[Robot Devil]] abducts him as he seduces several fembots.\n\nAs Fry and Leela track Bender to The Inferno ride at Reckless Ted's Funland, using [[Nibbler]] as a bloodhound, Bender is shown around Robot Hell by the Robot Devil in the form of a [[Robot Hell (Song)|song]]. Eventually Fry and Leela use the [[Fairness in Hell Act of 2275]] to challenge the Robot Devil to a fiddle contest for Bender's soul and a solid gold fiddle. If they lose, they get a small silver fiddle and the Robot Devil gets to kill Fry. While they are unable to best the devil in musical skill, Leela beats the Devil with the solid gold fiddle and the trio flee Robot Hell with a pair of stolen robotic wings The Robot Devil attempts to stop them by closing the ceiling gates. Luckily, the trio are able to escape by dropping the gold violin Leela was carrying, which was adding weight to their ascent. Once they are out of Robot Hell, Bender promises to be just evil/good enough.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Religion in Futurama]]\n*[[Robot Hell (song)]]\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 1]]"

It originally aired in North America on September 26, 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nReturning from a mission from planet Cannibalon, [[Fry]], [[Leela]], and [[Bender]] announce their resignations to Professor [[Hubert Farnsworth]]. They reconsider when the Professor tells them he has scheduled a company vacation as thanks for not reporting him about his disregard for employee safety. He tells them the vacation is a cruise on the maiden voyage of the largеst space cruise ship ever built: the ''[[Titanic]]''. No one suspects anything dangerous, despite the crash/sinking of the first luxury ship to have that name. As they board, they are stopped by [[Zapp Brannigan]], the honorary captain of the ''Titanic'' for its maiden voyage who attempts to seduce Leela again.\n\n[[File:Fakekiss.jpg|thumb|left|Leela kisses Fry while Zapp watches]]\nIn an attempt to avoid Brannigan's unwanted advances, Leela claims she's engaged to Fry. On the way to their room, Bender meets the [[Countess de la Roca]].\n\nOn the bridge, Brannigan diverts from the ship's original course and through a suicidally dangerous swarm of comets. At the buffet, [[Amy]] unexpectedly runs into her parents, [[Leo Wong|Leo]] and [[Inez Wong]], who immediately attempt to set Amy up with a date, one who's very unsightly to her. In order to redirect her parents' attention, Amy claims that Fry's her boyfriend, not realizing that Leela told Zapp that Fry's her fiancee.\n\nAt the ship's casino, Bender meets the Countess again and pretends to be rich to become her friend; at first he really wants her money and jewelry, until he realizes he loves her. Then she realizes he's broke after he steals a drinks from the bar, but she claims she still loves him.\n\nIn the swimming pool capsule, a limbo competition is being held. [[Hermes]] is urged to limbo, but declines, remembering a traumatic incident from twenty years ago. He was on the Earth Olympic limbo team, but during the [[2980]] Olympics, a boy ran onto the field, wanting to be just like his hero Hermes. He tried to limbo under an Olympic level bar but broke his spine. It is implied that the boy died. Hermes has never limbo-ed since then. Brannigan takes time off from steering the ship to judge the limbo contest, and declares Leela the winner, despite her not having entered &quot;No matter, I know from personal experience just how horizontal you can get&quot;, Brannigan says. As a prize, she and Fry are invited to dinner at the captain's table.\n[[File:Bravekif.jpg|thumb|right|''&quot;No, it's noble of ''you'', Kif.  As of now you're in command!&quot;'']]\nAt dinner both Zapp Brannigan and Amy's parents are present and demanding Fry kiss his date. Before the fake relationships can be exposed, [[Kif]] calls Brannigan back to the bridge. The new course has placed the ship in danger. Brannigan's attempt to correct the problem results in the ship flying toward a black hole. Realizing the danger he has put them in, Brannigan promotes Kif to Captain so that he can go down with the ship while Brannigan escapes. Bender heads off to save the Countess, while the rest of the crew make their way to the escape pods. On the way, an airlock door begins to close, blocking the crew's escape. [[Zoidberg]] holds it from closing all the way, but the door release is on the other side and no one can reach it. Hermes resurrects his old limbo skills to squeeze under and hit the door release. Arriving at the escape pods, they meet Amy's parents, who have found Amy a new boyfriend they feel is suitable: Kif. After waiting as long as they can for Bender, the crew launches the escape pod. Bender leaps from the Titanic, Countess in tow. He grabs the escape pod, but they are overweight. The Countess sacrifices herself to allow the others to escape. Bender is heart broken at the sad sight. As he gets inside, Fry consoles him, stating that it may be possible that the Countess is alive in another dimension; Farnsworth thinks not, as he confides in Zoidberg. Bender says he has her diamond bracelet to remind him of her. When he asks Hermes how much it is worth, Hermes responds that the bracelet is fake, only causing Bender to cry.\n\n==Themes==\nIt is in this episode that the first romantic sparks fly between Fry and Leela. At first the appearance of romance is just a part of the ruse to keep Brannigan at bay, but when Leela sees Fry kissing Amy, she becomes (unexpectedly) jealous. Later, Fry and Leela almost share a genuine kiss before being interrupted by a gravitational jolt from the nearby black hole.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flight to Remember, A}}\n[[Category:Articles in need of a re-write]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 1]]"

Incensed that they do not get to see the end of the episode, the [[Omicronians]] launch an invasion fleet. Back on Earth, the [[Planet Express crew]] decides to take a trip to [[Monument Beach]], where most of the world's monuments have stood since the 27th century. A spaceship then lands on the beach as [[Lrrr]], ruler of Omicron Persei 8, demands that the Earth produce &quot;the one called McNeal&quot;. [[President McNeal]], fearing for his own safety, orders [[Zapp Brannigan]] to lead an assault against the alien invaders. Instead, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] gets blown up.\n\nAfter the attack ends in disaster, Earth's government hands [[President McNeal]] over to Lrrr. Lrrr announces that he is the wrong McNeal, and vaporizes the President. Lrrr shows the world a photo of the McNeal they want, and Fry recognizes her as [[Jenny McNeal]], the title character of Single Female Lawyer.\n\nThe Omicronians demand the broadcast of the television show, or they will destroy the Earth. Unfortunately, most videotapes were destroyed in [[2443]], during the second coming of Jesus. The Planet Express crew decides to fake the show in order to save the world.\n\nFry's script comes up short, and Leela, as Jenny, is forced to improvise. She proposes marriage to the judge (played by Professor Farnsworth). An aggravated Fry tells Bender, who is the camera, to go to commercial. Fry tells Leela that people don't watch TV for clever and unexpected situations because they scare them, and Lrrr makes a public statement backing up Fry's assertion.\n\nFry quickly writes an ending where the judge dies, leaving Jenny McNeal as a single female lawyer. The Omicronians, satisfied with the ending, leave Earth to watch a one thousand year old Jay Leno monologue, saying the show was good enough for them to spare the planet, though not good enough for them to give humans their secret to immortality.\n\nFry states that the secret to a successful television show is that everything ends up back to normal at the end of each episode.

He shines it at Bender and finds that [[Amy]]'s watch (which Bender had stolen) was causing the problem. After removing the watch, the professor leaves the F-ray and Fry and Bender decide to have some fun with it. Bender shines it on Fry, which may make him infertile or cause genetic defects in his children as Fry initially cries &quot;Ow, my sperm!&quot; but feels nothing when Bender shines it on him for a second time. After trying the F-ray out on random objects, Fry eventually realizes that they could use the F-ray to scan Slurm cans for the golden bottlecap. After checking thousands of cans, they give up on finding the winning can, and return the F-ray. Fry settles in to relax with a can of Slurm, and ends up choking on a bottlecap that was in it.\n\nThe [[Planet Express crew]] arrives at [[Slurm Centralized Industrial Fabrication Unit]] and are greeted by [[Glurmo]]. The crew takes a riverboat tour down a river of Slurm through the factory, and see the [[Grunka-Lunkas]] sing their song. Overwhelmed with thirst, Fry tries to drink from the river (not realizing that it's not in fact Slurm), and falls in. [[Leela]] dives in to save him, and Bender joins them for no good reason. The three are sucked into a whirlpool and deposited in a cave under the factory.\n\nUnder the factory, they discover that the factory they toured was a fake. Making their way through the tunnels, they enter the real factory and discover Slurm's true nature: it is a secretion from the rear orifice of a giant worm, the [[Slurm Queen]]. They are discovered and captured by the worms. The three are placed into overly complicated death traps and left unguarded. They escape, but are pursued by the Slurm Queen. Slurms MacKenzie, exhausted from his years of partying, arrives and sacrifices himself to save Fry, Leela, and Bender.\n\nWhen they escape, the Slurm Queen bemoans that the company is ruined, and disgustingly drinks her own Slurm, direct from the source, as a comfort. However, Fry is so addicted to Slurm that he keeps the nature of Slurm a secret so that it can continue to be produced.\n\n==Themes==\nIn this episode, Professor begins his long habit of pronouncing &quot;w&quot; words as though they begin with &quot;wh&quot;.

Or they might have had to, if not for the brilliant mind of [[Hubert J.

In the audio commentary for Bender's Big Score, it is joked about how many people are hiding around the room.\n\nIn a [[What-If Machine]] vision where Fry was never frozen, Applied Cryogenics was the starting point of a universe-wide implosion.\n\n== Employees ==\n=== Current Employees ===\n*[[Ipji]]\n*[[Terry]]\n*Another unnamed aide\n\n=== Past Employees ===\n*[[Bender]]\n*[[Fry]]\n*[[Leela]] (Officer 1B-DI)\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n* &quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Anthology of Interest I]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Cryonic Woman]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Jurassic Bark]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Why of Fry]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Law and Oracle]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Game of Tones]]&quot;\n=== Films ===\n*''[[Bender's Big Score]]''\n=== Comics ===\n*''[[New Year's Rockin' Evil]]''\n\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Locations]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]"

Zoidberg's catchphrase}}\n\n\n[[John A. Zoidberg]], better known as '''Zoidberg''', is one of the main characters in ''[[Futurama]].'' He was born on the planet [[Decapod 10]] and moved to [[Earth]] to practice medicine after giving up comedy once. Despite being a self-proclaimed expert on [[Humans]], he called [[Philip J. Fry]] &quot;young lady&quot; when they first met and has confused [[Fry]] and [[Bender]].  He speaks, as all [[Decapodian]]s do, with a heavy Yiddish accent. He is the nephew of famed eccentric movie celebrity [[Harold Zoid]]. On a number of occasions, Zoidberg has made mention of Hermes being his best friend.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nZoidberg is actually the alien discovered in [[Roswell|Roswell, New Mexico]] in [[1947]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Roswell that Ends Well]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to live in various places around the [[Planet Express building]], notably the [[Dumpster]], in which he has been seen numerous times looking for food and shelter. [[Zoidberg]] himself confessed to &quot;living in a dumpster&quot; in 3011, presumably the [[Planet Express building]] [[Dumpster]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Tip of the Zoidberg]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A conversation Zoidberg has with the [[Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor]] suggests that he is only staying with [[Planet Express]] because of a life debt to the Professor.  A series of flashbacks reveal that Zoidberg first met and befriended [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] in 2927, during a mission to kill a [[Tritonian Yeti]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; for [[Mom]]. During the mission, Zoidberg is attacked by a Tritonian Yeti, but is saved by Farnsworth, who is scratched by the Tritonian Yeti. Farnsworth now fears that he has contracted [[Hyper-Malaria]], a painful, fatal, incurable disease which can either strike instantly or remain dormant for years. He asks Zoidberg to perform a mercy killing if he ever exhibits symptoms of the disease. Grateful for the Professor having saved his life and killing the Tritonian Yeti, Zoidberg agrees. As a result, Zoidberg is employed by the Professor for the purpose of carrying out the task. He is technically homeless and very poor, being a very unsuccessful &quot;internal medicine doctor&quot;. Although claiming it was lost in a volcano, it is very likely that Zoidberg does not actually have a medical degree but rather has a doctorate in art history.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Duh-Vinci Code]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his professional incompetence, he has been drafted into the [[DOOP]] army as a MEAT surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[War is the H-Word]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHe is extremely poor and has stated several times that he has no home.  Even worse, he is even treated like a social pariah by mostly everyone around him. [[Hermes Conrad]] considers him as practically a slave and does not hesitate in treating him like one. He usually eats from the trash or a dumpster, mistaking the trash for food and is envious of even the smallest amounts of money due to his lack of knowledge in currency and economics.  Another factor of his poverty was mainly the fact that Hermes kept cutting Zoidberg's paychecks for no reason. He is excitable about his friends and is very trusting with the [[Planet Express crew|crew]]. He appears to be rather fond of all of them, only really disliking [[Bender Bending Rodríguez]]. Most of the crew (except possibly [[Fry]], Farnsworth, as well as [[Amy]]) finds Zoidberg (or at least his species) to be disgusting as he will eat almost anything and his extreme &quot;incompetence&quot; as a doctor has done nothing for his popularity. Although, sometimes the rest of the crew will be nice or care for him, except maybe Hermes. \n\nA composite of numerous sea creatures, Zoidberg's features have been myriad.  The most unique feature is his inability to feel physical pain. An example is in the episode &quot;[[Roswell that Ends Well]]&quot;, Zoidberg is aware that he is getting dissected without anethesia but he doesn't feel any type of pain as he gets dissected. His known attributes include a removable exoskeleton, a retractable head fin that indicates arousal, aggression, or fear, an ink gland, a &quot;stink gland&quot;, a gland that emits foul odors when he's bored, an empathy bladder, a freshwater stomach, a saltwater stomach, four hearts, a throat that apparently produces psychedelic blue pearls, as well as a &quot;wazoo&quot;.  This last item is apparently some sort of sex organ, the place where the &quot;male jelly&quot; comes out for the mating of his species.  It has been revealed that passing on genetic material is a life terminating event for these lobster people, so while the good doctor once informed [[Leo Wong]] that he 'took the liberty of fertilizing his caviar' for him, it remains ambiguous what actually transpired. Along with a &quot;wazoo&quot;, Zoidberg also has gonopores, as revealed in [[Neutopia]] when everyone's gender is taken away, when he looks in his pants and promptly yells &quot;My gonopores,&quot; and then tells everyone to &quot;look it up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Where the Buggalo Roam]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nZoidberg reverted through several of the early &quot;larval&quot; life cycle stages of his species after being exposed to a youth tar. He seems to have started off as a small immobile creature from which asexually fragmented &quot;brothers&quot; could separate (each with a distinct personality). A later stage was a parasitic lamprey, followed by a large clam inside which his head was visible. The next oldest form resembled a trilobite. Other stages included a sea urchin and a cuttlefish.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nZoidberg is indirectly and unintentionally responsible for a number of disasters and misfortunes which befall [[Earth]]'s people, including their enslavement by the [[Decapodians]] due to their overreaction of Zoidberg eating a flag and sentencing him to death after giving him an unfair trial.  Due to his alleged overacting in a TV series finale, the people of Earth are denied the [[Omicronian]] recipe for eternal life.  He is also partially responsible for the near sale of [[Planet Express]] to [[MomCorp]], due to foolishly trading all of his stocks to [[That Guy]] for a sandwich, which grew moldy because he kept it in his coat pocket.  That near sale was, however, mainly [[Philip Joshua Fry|Fry]]'s fault.\n\n==Romance(s)==\n[[File:Edna pic.jpg|thumb|192px|Edna]]\nEven though Zoidberg is generally disliked by everybody he comes into contact with, he did manage to find a little romance with a [[Lobster]] at the Hipster Club when [[Amy Wong]] took [[Turanga Leela]] out to find a man, walking out with the lobster in his arms after the bar closed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He also had fallen in love with [[Edna]], but the feelings weren't mutual: Edna fell in love with [[Philip J. Fry]] instead. He and the [[Jellyfish Nurse|Jellyfish Monster]] (who also served as his field nurse during the war) were seen sharing a glass of wine on the Titanic.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;. He is ultimately revealed to be currently married to an unknown wife in &quot;Benderama&quot; when [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth]] shredded his wedding album to make two small sweaters. It is unknown who Zoidberg's wife is but possible candidates are [[Grrl]], [[Candy]], as well as the Jellyfish Monster.\n\nIn the episode &quot;[[Stench and Stenchibility]]&quot;, Zoidberg falls in love with a flower merchant with no sense of smell called [[Marianne]]. After gaining a nose, Marianne enjoys Zoidberg's scent, as she had never learned a good smell from a bad smell. The two are presumed to have an ongoing relationship, as they are last seen together driving off in a garbage truck.\n\n== Personality ==\nOut of all the Planet express crew members, Zoidberg is considered to be the most caring and innocent member of the crew. He is a sweet and lovable guy who just wants a friend to hang out with but for some reason most people dislike him, especially Hermes. Despite this, Zoidberg considers everyone to be his friend. He is portrayed as a dumb, incompetent doctor due to his frequent surgical mishaps and misdiagnoses but he shows he is far from stupid as he shows he has knowledge in alien anatomy (not human, though he is a self-proclaimed &quot;human expert&quot;) and has a Ph.D. in Art History. He does not even have the guts to stand up to bullies and instead acts in a cowardly fashion towards them. He tries his hardest to prove that he is a trustworthy guy and he is constantly nice towards other people. The ostracism he receives from the Planet Express crew and society causes him to be a very lonely person. He is even very unaware that Hermes bullies him constantly and he does not dare to ask Hermes why he hates him so much. Despite this heavy unawareness, Zoidberg like any other employee, has a fear of getting fired. However in a recent episode it is shown that he is a long time friend and crew member of [[Hubert J. Fansworth|Professor Farnsworth's]] and the Professor won't fire him even though he has shown to be vastly incompetent at his job and is hated by most of his co-workers.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He appeared in a episode of duck dodgers.\n* His catchprase is &quot;HOORAY!&quot;\n*Zoidberg's birthday, May 5, is the day after [[Amy]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Time Keeps On Slippin']]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; but the Planet Express Crew always forgets his birthday.\n*Zoidberg is one of those who went inside Fry's body in &quot;[[Parasites Lost]]&quot;.\n*Zoidberg's medical specialty is declaring people medically dead, whether they are or not. He is also very skilled in suturing hands back together, especially with human hands.\n*Zoidberg had a brief acting career, having played a minor role in ''[[The Magnificent Three]]''.\n*His uncle, Harold Zoid, is a legendary movie director and actor and an Oscar winner.\n*Even though he is poor, he somehow obtained the money to buy the new eyePhone in &quot;[[Attack of the Killer App]]&quot;.\n*It is revealed in &quot;[[Bendless Love]]&quot; that he has a pet Slinky, which is actually his favorite toy.\n*Zoidberg is often forced to clean up messes around the Planet Express building by the other employees, even when the mess was made by everyone, though this should be [[Scruffy]]'s job.\n*When Zoidberg received $300 from the mass tax refund, he thought he was rich. This shows that Zoidberg is bad at economics. Also in &quot;[[Viva Mars Vegas]]&quot;, he was shown to have collected and saved several pennies in his jar which he thought would be enough for him to do gambling, even though this only amounted to perhaps only a few dollars. Amy has known Zoidberg to have primitive habits on managing money and this leads to Amy ripping on Zoidberg for being poor, though she apologizes to him for that later on. Part of the reason why Amy ripped on Zoidberg for being poor was because Amy herself was the daughter of a rich couple.\n*He is an honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters along with [[Professor Farnsworth]], [[Amy]] and [[Hermes]].\n*In the episode &quot;[[The Silence of the Clamps]]&quot;, it is revealed that the only reason he is a member of Planet Express is to snip and cut, as well as is extremely sensitive about this role. However it was also revealed in &quot;[[The Tip of the Zoidberg]]&quot; that he was a member of Planet Express for the sole purpose of performing euthanasia on Professor Farnsworth because Farnsworth was sick with yetiism, which was mistaken for hypermalaria.\n*He once managed to beat the ever-loving daylight out of a Mob Enforcer with his bare claws.\n*Zoidberg and [[Professor Farnsworth]] have been friends since 2927.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Tip of the Zoidberg]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Young zoidberg and professor.jpg|thumb|320px|John Zoidberg and Hubert Farnsworth working for [[MomCorp]] in the year 2927.]]\n* As of the statement above, it is indicated that Zoidberg is older than 80. Presumably in his 100's as Zoidberg in the photo looks in his 20's\n*Zoidberg '''is''' a competent physician, but not for humans. He is competent in the anatomy of aliens and even Mom recognizes his skillfulness with aliens.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Tip of the Zoidberg]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n*In addition to his fake medical degree, he says to have mail-ordered murderology and murderonomy degrees.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Anthology Of Interest I]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n*He is the only known being to be deemed &quot;good&quot; by [[Robot Santa Claus]] as he was given a pogo stick as a gift. The reason for this could be an error in the Santa Claus or because of his kind and innocent personality.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Xmas Story]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;.\n*It was once revealed that he lives in one of [[Professor Farnsworth]]'s inventions. However, he officially lives in his dumpster due to his poverty. The closest he ever got to having a real home was when he made one out of a seashell only to have it burned down by Bender despite the fact that it was underwater.\n*Despite his poor skills as a comedian, he is shown to be very skilled at ventriloquism.\n*Zoidberg is one of two characters who are known primarily by their surname: the other is [[Fry]]. [[Leela]] doesn't count as it's revealed in [[Less than Hero]] that Turanga is Leela's surname.\n* Frequently makes a &quot;whooping&quot; sound, which is based on Curly from The Three Stooges.\n* He has a gland which generates foul odors when bored,as he demonstrated in Bender's Big Score\n\n== Behind the Scenes ==\nIn the development process for the show, [[David X. Cohen]] looked to the original [[Star Trek]] series for inspiration. Dr. Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy often operated on alien species, so they decided to have an alien doctor that served the human crew and as the series unfolded it became clear that Zoidberg's medical ability was lacking with humans but highly skilled with aliens, which makes him a spoof of Dr. McCoy. Additionally, Zoidberg's character also took on other running jokes: he became poor, lonely, as well as a failed comedian in addition to being a horrible doctor.\n\nThe name &quot;Zoidberg&quot; comes from a game for the Apple II, that Cohen developed when he was in high school. Although ''Zoid'' was never picked up, it became the basis for Zoidberg's name.\n\nThe voice for Dr. Zoidberg was developed by [[Billy West]], influenced by actors Lou Jacobi and George Jessel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/06/15/billy-west-the-tv-squad-interview&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Gallery==\n[[File:Zoidberg cameo in duck dodgers.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]\n&lt;gallery&gt;\nTip of the zoidberg.png\nFuturamatipofthezoidberg.png\nZoidbergTeenager.jpg\n500 foot tall Zoidberg and The Apollo Theater.png\nZoidbergWithFlag.jpg\nZoidberghead.png\nHermeszoid-1.png\nFemale Zoidberg.jpg|Female Zoidberg\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{MainCharacters}}\n\n[[es:John A.

Panucci believed that only three monsters existed: Dracula, Blackula, and Son of Kong; he also believed that [[Fry]] would be a delivery boy for the rest of his life.

Fry found the hungry dog circa [[1997]] on the streets of [[Old New York]]. His breed is thought to be based off the [[wikipedia:border terrier|border terrier]]. Fry decided to befriend him and feed him some of the pizza from the delivery he was currently on, which was another prank call. Giving the hungry dog the first slice of pizza, [[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory|Fry]] mentions that if anyone should ask that he should claim to be the delivery recipient &quot;Seymour Asses&quot;. Fry eventually taught him to bark/sing ''[[Walking on Sunshine]]''. He was noted for having wet dog smell, even when he was dry. When Fry later fell into a cryogenics tube where he remained for nearly 1000 years,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; he led members of Fry's family to the cryogenics laboratory but failed to convince them to examine the tube and they dragged him away.\n\nHis petrified remains were found by Fry in the 31st century at a museum exhibit of [[Panucci's Pizza]]. Professor [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] had the technology to extract DNA from the remains and create a clone of Seymour, complete with memories, but Fry declined, reasoning that since the readings indicated Seymour had lived to the age of 15, 12 years after Fry was frozen (Dec. 31st 1999/Jan. 1st 2000), Seymour must have formed new memories and eventually forgotten about Fry. The truth was, however, that Seymour had waited outside Panucci's Pizza for Fry's return every day since he was frozen, obeying his master's last command, never leaving the spot and never giving up hope.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Jurassic Bark]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHowever, a time clone Fry created through the use of the [[paradox-free time travel machine]] (''[[Bender's Big Score]]'') decides to stay 12 Years in the past until he eventually becomes [[Lars Fillmore]] through a failed assassination attempt by [[Bender]] – and returns to the future. In total Fry and Seymour enjoy 15 years together starting in 1997 until Bender's failed assassination attempt in 2012, during which Seymour becomes petrified in [[dolomite]], sparing the noble dog from the cruel fate he was originally dealt.\n\nIn ''The Simpsons'' crossover episode &quot;[[Simpsorama]]&quot;, Seymour is shown asleep in front of Panucci's Pizza (both somehow in Springfield).

June 30, 2972) is an egotistical military officer for the [[Democratic Order of Planets]] and [[Earth's Government]] of at least a Captain: usually of the Earth Ship [[Nimbus]], but briefly of the luxury liner [[Titanic]]. Later in the series, he is introduced as a ''Twenty-Five Star General'' or ''General Major Webelo.'\n\n== Personality ==\nAlthough Zapp Brannigan is considered a great military hero by many people, most who have met him are less impressed by his arrogant, incompetent, perverted, phallic, selfish, egotistic, chauvinistic, bossy, cocky, manipulative,  supremely vain personality, as well as his incredible stupidity.\n\n=== Sexuality ===\n[[File:Love'sLaboursLostinSpace.png|thumb|left|Zapp &quot;seduces&quot; Leela]]\n\n{{Quotebox|I made it with a woman! Inform the men!|Zapp|''[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]''}}\n\nZapp considers himself a &quot;ladies' man&quot; and despite ample evidence to the contrary, acts as if he is irresistible to the female gender. He is seen flirting with a lot of women , including Leela.\n\nBrannigan appears to lack any concept of romance and his strategies for wooing a woman include either using his status as a high-ranking member of the military or to say as many of his pickup lines in as little time as he can, not stopping for anything. Some examples of his brand of pickup lines include: &quot;If I said you had a beautiful body would you take your pants off and dance around a little?&quot; and &quot;I find the most erotic part of the woman is the boobies.&quot;\n\nWhen he is lucky enough to &quot;score&quot; (for example when [[Leela]] was guilted into having pity sex with him), he enjoys boasting about it to everyone, even at the most inappropriate moments.\n\nProbably one of Brannigan's most well-known features is his lack of pants, which he deems &quot;for the weak.&quot; Judging by Kif's disgusted reactions when following him up a ladder, he evidently eschews underwear as well.\n\nHe is also known to be somewhat of a pervert as he once forced Leela to take of her shirt to expose her bare upper body while on Mars.\n\n==== Masochism ====\nOne aspect of Brannigan's sexuality which appears from time to time is his fondness for being hurt by women (BDSM). Aside from his frequent contact with Leela (who often rebuffs his advances with physical force) this is shown when he and the [[Planet Express crew|Planet Express Crew]] were stranded on the planet [[Amazonia]] and were forced to have &quot;snu-snu&quot; with the [[Amazonian|natives]]. He was asking to be held tighter and even asked for a hard spanking. Despite the great physical trauma he sustained, Brannigan looks back on the event happily. Or when Brannigan joins the [[Planet Express Crew]], he offers to take place of Fry and Bender if there is ever a &quot;bare bottom spanking policy&quot;.\n\n=== Karaoke ===\nBrannigan highly prizes his singing, calling himself &quot;the Velour Fog&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Velvet Fog&quot;, Mel Tormé. He does a seemingly William Shatner-esqe version of ''Lola'', replacing the name Lola with Leela, to win back Leela's attention during an open-mic night on [[Le Palm D'Orbit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]&quot;&gt;''[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The results of his singing are predictable, as everyone runs screaming to escape pods and leaves, including the crew. Zapp is able to ignore the fact his singing makes everyone run.\n\n=== Speech Impediment ===\nBrannigan's self-confident manner is also manifested in a speech impediment (which may or may not be intentional, but also possibly a result of his intense stupidity), several words which Zapp has trouble with include:\n*''Champagne'' (he pronounces the silent g)\n*''Bravo'' ('brave-o')\n*''Minestrone''\n*''Encore'' ('EN-core', instead of 'ON-core')\n*''Guacamole'' (like 'whack-a-mole'),\n*Quesadilla (pronounces ques as cass)\n*''Parmesan (par-mee-see-an)''\n*''Finale (final-le)''\n*''Chinese''\n*''Tube ''\n* Matrimony (Macaroni)\nOddly enough, Zapp has no problem pronouncing other words such as:\n*''Chutzpah''\n*''Karaoke''\n\nThis may be due to his &quot;very sexy&quot; learning disability: [[Sexlexia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;[[War is the H-Word]]&quot;&gt;''[[War is the H-Word]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Relationships ==\n[[File:KifAndZapp.jpg|thumb|Kif and Zapp on the bridge of the Nimbus]]\n=== Relationship with Kif Kroker ===\n{{Quotebox|Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame. Steady, steady ... now!|Zapp|''[[When Aliens Attack]]''}}\n\n[[Kif Kroker]], the beleaguered lieutenant and personal assistant, is usually at Brannigan’s side and is often given the blame when things go wrong, which is more often than not. Zapp is unconsciously very abusive to Kif. Zapp usually treats Kif like a slave and very often bullies him. Although Brannigan is often unconcernedly and unknowingly cruel towards him, Kif is also the closest thing Zapp has to a friend.\n\n=== Relationship with Turanga Leela ===\n{{Quotebox|... you're the only woman who ever loved me!|Zapp|''[[Brannigan, Begin Again]]''}}\n[[Turanga Leela]] was once tricked into having pity sex with Zapp&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;&gt;''[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and after that, Zapp kept trying to date her even though Leela always said no, sometimes with violence involved. She was also forced to have sex with him when &quot;V-GINY' went out to destroy Earth for its lack of censorship.\n\n=== Relationship with Amy Wong ===\nZapp once had sex with [[Amy Wong]] after her ''[[Fonfon Ru]]'', Kif, died. This relationship didn't last and when Kif came back to life, he and Amy broke off their relationship because of this.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Military History ==\n[[File:Zapp1.jpg|thumb|right|Brannigan leads his troops]]\n{{Quotebox|Men, you're lucky men. Soon, you'll all be fighting for your planet. many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be put through a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all.|Zapp|''[[War is the H-Word]]''}}\nWhile perhaps not the best leader of men, Zapp is a dedicated soldier who does his duty despite not always understanding what that means. When asked by one of his men why they were expected to fight and die for a planet with no value to earth whatsoever, he responds: “'Don't ask me: it's you who'll be dying!” Brannigan also values the law more than friendship, such as when he persues the [[Planet Express crew]] into a wormhole.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]&quot;&gt;''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== A Charismatic Leader ===\nWhile not the most inspirational leader, Brannigan is able to motivate his troops if he needs to. For example, before sending his men onto [[Spheron I]], he tells them, &quot;We can only assume this: they stand for everything we ''don't'' stand for. Also, they told me you guys look like dorks!&quot;  However, Zapp usually conjures up war strategies that even a child could easily conjure up and they are usually poorly thought out\n\nOn the other hand, his troops are not always particularly fond of him. During a meal in the ''[[Nimbus]]'' mess hall when he raised a glass and called for support, met only by a stony silence and one anonymous crewman yelling &quot;You suck!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;[[War is the H-Word]]&quot;&gt;''[[War is the H-Word]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Tactics ===\n{{Quotebox|...And like all my plans, it's so simple an idiot could have devised it!|Zapp|''[[When Aliens Attack]]''}}\nThese examples show a consistent approach to battles in Brannigan’s tactics. He generally triumphs over weaker foes that often lack the ability to fight back.\n\nHe doesn’t seem to make any attempt to understand his enemy, their culture, tactics, or any other aspects of his foes before engaging them. Instead he sends waves of cannon fodder to overwhelm the enemy and when this fails he gives up.\n\nHe has written at least one book about military tactics, titled ''Zapp Brannigan's Big Book of War'',&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;/&gt; based heavily on Sun Tzu's ''The Art of War'' and looks like a Dr. Seuss book with his face on it.\n\n=== Battle with the Kill-bots ===\nAt some point before the beginning of the series, Zapp defeated a foe known as [[killbots]], by sending wave after wave of his own men at them until the killbots reached their pre-programmed kill limit and shut down.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;/&gt;\n\n=== Vergon 6 ===\nUpon meeting the [[Planet Express crew]] over [[Vergon 6]], Zapp arrests them for violating [[Brannigan's Law]], but later releases them after ''scoring'' with Leela.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;/&gt;\n\n=== As Captain of the ''Titanic'' ===\nZapp is given the honorific command of the maiden voyage of the luxury liner the ''[[Titanic]]''. Unfortunately, the simple and safe route planned for the voyage was not exciting enough for Brannigan, so he altered the flight plan to a more challenging one. The new route brought the ship dangerously close to comets and black holes, but it was only when the ship flew into a black hole that Zapp realized his mistake. After leaving Kif in charge, Zapp fled the ''Titanic'' and left its passengers to their fates.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[A Flight to Remember]]&quot;&gt;''[[A Flight To Remember]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== War Against Omicron Persei 8 ===\n{{Quotebox|If we hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.|Zapp|''[[When Aliens Attack]]''}}\nWhen his enemies actually fight back shows how 'good' a commander Zapp is. When the [[Omicronians]] [[When Aliens Attack|invade Earth]], Brannigan is put in charge of the defense of [[Earth]]. He orders his forces to &quot;line up and fly directly at the enemy death cannons, clogging them with wreckage&quot;, and amid heavy losses, his forces succeed in destroying what turned out to be the Hubble Space Telescope. When the Omicronian forces actually engaged the DOOP fleet, Zapp’s forces are effortlessly decimated and Earth is defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[When Aliens Attack]]&quot;&gt;''[[When Aliens Attack]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Dismissal from the DOOP ===\n[[File:BranniganBeginAgain.png|thumb|right|Zapp and Kif after being dismissed from the DOOP]]\n{{Quotebox|&quot;What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?&quot;|Zapp|''[[Brannigan, Begin Again]]''}}\nAs the great hero of DOOP military forces, Brannigan is given the honor of cutting the ribbon at the opening of the new $400 billion DOOP space station. Zapp is distracted by the arrival of the Planet Express crew who were delivering the ceremonial scissors for the ribbon cutting and promptly arrests and detains them in his flagship, charging them with conspiring with the [[Neutral|neutral people]]. When the time comes, he opts to cut the ribbon by using the tactical laser, on its highest setting Hyperdeath™, from the ''Nimbus'' rather than returning to the station. After Zapp arrogantly ignores Kif's warning about using the laser, He accidentally cuts not only the ribbon, but the entire station in two pieces. After this, DOOP's commander was willing to dismiss .also gave his dismissal speech at that time and in the midst of it, frames Kif for masterminding the destruction of DOOP headquarters, giving Kif a dishonorable discharge as well.\n\n=== Reinstatement to DOOP ===\nAfter joining the Planet Express crew, Brannigan instigated a mutiny and used his new position as captain to attack the home world of his hated enemies: the [[Neutral Planet]]. During the resulting trial, Leela lies for Zapp so he won't return to Planet Express&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Brannigan, Begin Again]]&quot;&gt;''[[Brannigan, Begin Again]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Invasion of Spheron I ===\nDuring the war for Spheron I, “a barren wasteland with no natural resources or any strategic value,” Zapp displays his foolhardy type of tactics, by sending his men on suicidal attacks on the ball-people. He ultimately succeeds in negotiating the surrender of his foes after installing a powerful bomb in the chest cavity of a [[Bender|brave soldier]].\n\n=== Defense of Earth from Decapodians ===\nAfter the political [[A Taste Of Freedom|friction]] between Earth and [[Decapod 10]], the [[Decapodians]] invade Earth. Brannigan unwisely trusts a barely disguised Decapodian spy, [[Hugh Man]], with the command codes for Earth’s global defense system and Earth falls to the invaders with ease, though Zapp predictably blames Kif for the debacle.\n\nBrannigan also plays a minor role in the resistance to the Decapodian occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[A Taste of Freedom]]&quot;&gt;''[[A Taste of Freedom]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\nN\n\n=== Court-Martial of the Planet Express Crew ===\nUpon finding the Planet Express crew in the middle of a battle with [[Melllvar]], Brannigan arrests and court-martials them for setting foot on the forbidden [[planet]] [[Omega 3]], even though Melllvar hasn't stopped attacking.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]&quot;&gt;''[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== War for Tarantulon 6 ===\nAfter his victorious conquest of the &quot;weak and womanlike&quot; Spiderians of Tarantulon 6, the resulting plunder was split up between Earth’s inhabitants, $300 for each person.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]&quot;&gt;''[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Battle for Earth Against the Scammers ===\nAfter the entire Earth was scammed out of their belongings by the [[Nude Alien Scammers]], the exiled Earthlings, as well as several other factions, eventually decided to fight back and assembled a fleet to engage the Scammers’ solid gold Death Stars. Although Brannigan initially took command of the attack, his suicidal tactics led to high casualties and he was soon succeeded in command by the [[Planet Express ship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Bender's Big Score]]&quot;&gt;''[[Bender's Big Score]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Operation Against The Anomaly ===\nAfter a tear in the universe, the [[anomaly]], appears, [[President of Earth|Earth President]], [[Richard Nixon's head|Nixon]] decides to send a military expedition to destroy the anomaly, led by Zapp Brannigan. When the ''Nimbus'' reached the anomaly, Brannigan ordered a missile to be fired into it, but the missile malfunctioned. Zapp ordered Kif to unjam the ordinance, but caused him to become stuck to it when he repeatedly pressed the launch button. The resulting event brings about Kif’s death, although [[Yivo]] eventually brings Kif back to life.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]&quot;/&gt;\n\n=== Other Operations ===\nZapp Brannigan is also known to have been involved in the following military engagements:\n*Carpet Bombed Eden 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Brannigan, Begin Again]]&quot;/&gt;\n*Defeated the Pacifists of Gandhi Nebula.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[When Aliens Attack]]&quot;/&gt;\n*Conquered the Retiree People of the Assisted Living Nebula.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[A Flight to Remember]]&quot;/&gt;\n*Failed to stop invaders from [[Nintenduu 64]] in an alternate reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Anthology of Interest II]]&quot;&gt;''[[Anthology of Interest II]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Tried to orchestrate a war against the Carcaron species\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n*&quot;''[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[A Flight to Remember]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[When Aliens Attack]]&quot;''\n* &quot;[[I Second That Emotion]]&quot; (mentioned)\n*&quot;''[[Brannigan, Begin Again]]&quot;''\n*''[[The Lesser of Two Evils]]''\n*''[[Put Your Head On My Shoulders]]''\n*''[[Raging Bender]]''\n*''[[The Problem with Popplers]]''\n*''[[Anthology of Interest I]]''\n*''[[War is the H-Word]]''\n*''[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]''\n*''[[Where the Buggalo Roam]]''\n*''[[The Route of All Evil]]'' (cameo on lunchbox)\n*''[[I Dated a Robot]]''\n*''[[Anthology of Interest II]]'' (only in animatic)\n*''[[Future Stock]] (cameo)\n*''[[Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch]]''\n*''[[A Taste of Freedom]]''\n*''[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]''\n*''[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]''\n*''[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]''\n*''[[Rebirth]]''\n*''[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela]]''\n*''[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]\n*''[[Neutopia]]''\n*''[[Benderama]]''\n*''[[Ghost in the Machines]]''\n*''[[Cold Warriors]]''\n*''[[A Farewell to Arms]]''\n*''[[The Thief Of Baghead]]''\n*''[[Zapp Dingbat]]''\n*''[[Fun on a Bun]]''\n*''[[Naturama]]'' (as a salmon)\n*''[[T.: The Terrestrial]]''\n*''[[The Inhuman Torch]]''\n*''[[Saturday Morning Fun Pit]]''\n*''[[Meanwhile]]''\n\n===Movies===\n*''[[Bender's Big Score]]''\n*''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''\n*''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''\n\n===Comics===\n*''[[...But Deliver Us To Evil!]]''\n*''[[DOOP The Right Thing!]]''\n*''[[More Than A Filling!]]''\n*''[[Soldier Boys]]''\n*''[[Full Metal Racket]]''\n*''[[Homeward Boned]]''\n*''[[Welcome To My Nightmall]]''\n*''[[The Fry and the Furious!]]''\n*''[[Slaves of New New York!]]''\n\n==Trivia==\n*His favourite fabric is velour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20020401223746/www.fox.com/futurama/bios/bran.htm FOX Broadcasting Company - Zapp Brannigan profile]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n*Originally, Zapp Brannigan was to be voiced by Phil Hartman.

The professor, in agony, screams for help, but [[Bender]] continues sleeping, and [[Fry]] continues attempting to take [[Leela]] out on a date. She rejects him, saying she left her toaster on. They speak loudly to be heard over the booms and zaps from upstairs, where the Professor, still in distress, cries out to Buddha, then Zeus, then God, for assistance. Fry asks her real reasons for not wanting to go out, over the invocations from the lab. Farnsworth demands Satan's help, noting, &quot;You owe me!&quot; Still loudly, Leela replies, &quot;..I have sweaty boot rash!&quot; Unfortunately, the explosions end just before she says it. [[Amy]] ends up overhearing, and notes it's why she's sitting far away from her. Fry laughs...and asks again for a date.\n[[File:Parallelbox.png|thumb|left|The parallel universe box]]\nIn the conference room, filled with debris due to the explosion, Farnsworth happily states with his usual &quot;good news&quot; that's he's technically still alive, but he needs them to drop off the [[Parallel Universe Box]] containing the experiment that nearly killed him into the [[sun]]. Only hurling it into the &quot;thermonuclear inferno&quot; of sun itself, he explains, will &quot;ensure its total destruction&quot;.\n\nA curious [[Zoidberg]] tries to look in the box, Farnsworth convinces him, with a hammer, to desist; the [[Planet Express crew]] are warned that whatever is inside is probably beyond their comprehension. Even [[Hermes]] becomes inquisitive; Farnsworth again uses the hammer. Dramatically stating that no matter what they're all forbidden from looking inside the box, he then notes how tantalizing it is.\n\nZoidberg, food crazed, tries frantically to open the box. A gun wielding Hermes scares him, Bender, and Fry away from the box. Hermes then gives the gun to Leela and tells her to shoot the three. Leela adds, &quot;Right. If they try to look in the box.&quot; Hermes shrugs. &quot;Whatever&quot;.\n\nFry, and Bender are now in the conference room, and Fry decides to forget about the box. Bender calls Fry naive and states Farnsworth was joking. Fry isn’t fooled, so Bender drops the charade, and simply tells Fry to follow him. They go to the basement and crawl into a superheated steam vent, using it to get directly above the box. Bender replaces his regular eyes with periscopes, to scout the room, and notices Leela is sleeping. Laughing, he extends his arm, and takes the mystery box with ease.\n\nBack in the basement the two open the box and discover the box contains... tangled [[Xmas]] lights, and unlabeled booze in a wide mouth bottle. Leela, who was only pretending to be sleeping, states the decoy box should distract the two, and gets up. It turns out she was sitting on the real box all along. Satisfied that protecting the box will be a simple chore since no one's curious about it, she tries to read a magazine, unfortunately, she is now also starting to show curiosity about the box.\n\nNevertheless, Leela has managed to keep the box safe throughout the night, and the clock in the room strikes 7 am. Mildly irritated by now, she complains that protecting the box made her miss an evening of television watching, and decides to drink some coffee. She walks up to the coffee dispenser, and starts to put in change, but pulls back, deciding to flip the coin to determine whether or not she should look in the box. Heads she looks, and tails she doesn’t.\n\nThe coin turns up heads, and an elated Leela walks up to the box, but her sense of duty kicks in and she turns around. Still, since she promised the coin, she opens the box, and looks in. She curiously notes the box is much deeper than it should be, accidentally falls into it, and comes out of a different colored box, bumping her head in the process. A hurt Leela proclaims her lawyer will hear about this, and Fry’s voice is heard asking what she did. She panics and asks “what do you mean why was I looking in the box?”. A Fry with black hair, and a green jacket, asks her why her hair is different.\n[[File:Twoleelas.jpg|thumb|right|Leela A and Leela 1]]\nA gold colored Bender walks in and Leela squints and asks if he ''is'' Bender. With his usual arrogance, he states yes. Next, Professor Farnsworth walks into the room, but he has an odd scar going around his head. Then, another Leela comes in - with red hair.\n\nThis shocks everyone and Farnsworth realizes that he created an alternate universe, which he presumes to be evil. He has his &quot;good&quot; Leela go into the other universe to bring others to them. Leela brings back everyone else except Hermes. The two Professors then argue over who created what universe and decided to have their counterparts watch each other. They then declare the universe there are in is [[Parallel_universe#Universe_1|Universe 1]] and the other [[Parallel_universe#Universe_A|Universe A]].\n\nAs the crew talk to their counterparts, it is revealed that Fry-1 and Leela-1 are married, due to a flip of the coin and that Fry-1 bought Leela-1 a diamond scrunchy and they were married; Fry-A was beaten up at a Neil Diamond concert by a man named Scrunchy; Farnsworth-1 had cut out his own brain through flip of a coin and managed to get it back in. Eventually, after checking the scriptures, the Professors decide that neither universe is evil. However, just as Hermes-1 comes in, the Professors realize that Hermes-A will be going to the sun to destroy the box.\n\nBut when they try to get the box out of the aquatic tank, they find it gone, stolen by the two Zoidbergs, who had been feeling unappreciated. They attempt to recreate the box to their universe only to create several others. When the Zoidbergs arrive back with the box, they escape into other universes. Therefore, everyone else had to search every other universe, grabbing wire to find their way back. After tireless searching, they find the Zoidbergs in [[Parallel_universe#Universe_420|Universe 420]] and managed to get back to Universe-A to stop Hermes from destroying their box.\n\nBack at Planet Express, both Universe-1 and A pull their respective boxes from the inside-out. Essentially, Universe-A has a box containing their own universe. Bender shakes the box a little, causing an earthquake. As Fry sits on the box to watch television, the universe momentarily folds in on itself.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Injury, Death, Dismemberment===\n* The opening scene places Farnsworth in the middle of a long series of explosions.\n* Bender recounts an incident in which he &quot;pounded a guy into the ground with a shovel.&quot;\n* Farnsworth smacks Zoidberg's claw and Hermes' collator with a hammer.\n* Fry burns himself crawling around in steam vents.\n* Bender removes his regular eyes and replaces them with periscope eyes.\n* Leela &quot;A&quot; falls out of a parallel-universe box and lands on her head on the floor.\n* Leela &quot;One&quot; delivers an off-screen karate blow to Zoidberg &quot;A&quot;.\n* The remaining crew from Universe &quot;A&quot; fall out of the parallel-universe box and land on top of each other on the floor.\n* Farnsworth &quot;One&quot; punches Farnsworth &quot;A&quot; in the mouth.\n* Leelas &quot;A&quot; and &quot;One&quot; attempt to fight, but knock each other out.\n* Farnsworth &quot;One&quot; smacks himself in the head with a wrench.\n* Fry &quot;A&quot; gets his head frozen in a block of ice.\n* All of the crew from both universes, except for Hermes &quot;A&quot;, are yanked into Universe &quot;One&quot; and slammed into Farnsworth's wire contraption. They all then jump into the Universe &quot;A&quot; box and fall out on top of each other onto the floor of the ship's airlock.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nThe opening scene shows Fry making a surprisingly determined effort to get Leela to go out with him. Leela clearly isn't going for the idea, as she cowers away from Fry on the other side of the couch and finally rejects his request with, &quot;I have sweaty boot-rash!&quot;\n\nAfter distracting Fry and Bender with the decoy box, she says to herself, &quot;That'll keep those dopes occupied.&quot;\n\nIn Universe &quot;One&quot;, Fry and Leela are married. Leela &quot;One&quot; tells the story to the others. The story makes it clear that Fry is indeed capable of impressing Leela, and not just on one date, but over the long term.\n\nAfter everyone goes back to their home universe, Fry asks Leela once again to go out with him. Leela flips a coin, but then decides against looking at it, and simply accepts his invitation.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* There are many alternate universes, each with its own compliment of Planet Express crew.\n* Leela makes a box full of unlabeled booze and tangled Xmas lights and passes it off as the real box.\n\n===Hermes-isms===\n* ''Scram, you lousy greensnakes.''\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

Comfortable with the new &quot;moderate intelligence&quot; the damaged hat produces, he decides to abandon academic greatness in favor of business school.

Though she is nervous about going back to the place where she was mocked for having one eye, she decides to rub her success in her former &quot;friends&quot; faces.  When she gets to the party, the others are far worse off, have low-aspiring jobs or 'selling whatever falls of of them' but still mock her, only to be shooed away by [[Adlai Atkins]]. Adlai is the only other successful orphan and Leela had a crush on him the past. Having become a phaser eye surgeon, Adlai offers to give Leela another eye to make her more normal. Leela accepts, despite [[Fry]]'s objections. \n\nMeanwhile, [[Bender]] adopts twelve orphans to get a $100 a week child government stipend. He abuses his position as their foster parent by telling them to sleep during the daytime and starving them. He soon finds out that the cost of keeping the children outweighs the stipend he has been getting and tries to sell them on the black market. [[URL]] and [[Smitty]] get tipped off and arrests Bender for &quot;crimes too numerous to list&quot;.\n\nLeela, after getting into a relationship with Adlai, wants to adopts [[Sally]], a lonely girl who has an ear on her forehead.

Professor Farnsworth shouts at him, saying, &quot;''Pazuzum, you ungrateful gargoyle. I put you through college and this is how you repay me!''&quot; before gargoyle droppings hit his face. He heads to the ship, forcing Fry and Leela to strap themselves completely to their seats and Bender bolts himself to the wall. The Professor flies out into space but is slowing down traffic, everyone scolding at him. Farnsworth inadvertently has the high beams on, incinerating a direction sign and blowing up [[Wikipedia:Deep_Space_9|Deep Space 9]] while searching for Pazuzu.\n\nForgetting about Pazuzu, Farnsworth redirects to [[Florida]] for a nice lunch. Unfortunately, his lifetime discount is expired and he activates his nuclear-powered teeth, which runs amok after tasting human blood. Fed up with his senility, the [[Planet Express crew]] take him to a day spa, where he is properly massaged. Because he is 161 years old, he is put in the anti-aging pits. But [[Bender]] pumps the pits too hard and the Professor is tossed up and down until the tar sinks into the ground. The ground gives way beneath the crew and they all fall in. Everyone climbs out and gets cleaned up: the Professor is looking middle aged, but the others are teenagers.\n\nWhile Farnsworth tries to fix things, the others try to settle into their teenage lives. [[Amy]] goes home to [[Mars]] where her [[Inez Wong|mom]] is angry cause she wants a grandchild and her [[Leo Wong|dad]] makes fun of her fat physique, [[Hermes]] goes home with [[LaBarbara]] and [[Dwight]], Leela tries to enjoy a normal teenage life in the sewers while Bender, [[Fry]] and [[Zoidberg]] stay at Planet Express. Fry (who has a cracked voice) soon begins dating Leela but in a sewer race with [[Mandy]] and [[Moose]], they destroy a [[wikipedia:Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther Thing, Jr.]] [[wikipedia:High school|High School]].\n\nSoon, the Professor discovers time-altering [[chronitons]] on their DNA and Bender's RNA and finds a way to get them back to their normal ages: Leela declines and continues her teenage life. The others get into the [[Bacterial Spew Chamber]] which &quot;coughs&quot; a gas on them. Unfortunately, the machine has the opposite effect - they are getting younger by the minute. Farnsworth tries to think of another solution but the kids' constant whining leads him to hire Leela as the babysitter. She discovers the existence of the [[Fountain of Aging]] from a story book and contacts the Professor. He picks up the kids while Leela stays grounded, willingly, until she sneaks out at night. She guides the now-much-younger Farnsworth to the fountain, which is on top of a burnt-out sun. As time is running out, they locate it.\n\n[[Norman]], one of Zoidberg's siblings, jumps in, growing older until he dies and crumbles. Worse, the others have become fetuses and Bender is a blueprint disc. Farnsworth quickly gets them in but the current carries them off as they age. To save them, Leela jumps in to save them and gives up her teenage appearance. They emerge in their underwear but the Professor is still stuck. Just then, Pazuzu rescues him. Scans indicate that Farnsworth is even older and Leela and Amy feel a bit younger. The Professor then repays the gargoyle by freeing him.

After Leela has saved the crew from &quot;pre-life&quot;, as she reflects that she is happy with her choice to return to adulthood with her friends, she and Fry share a meaningful glance, but nothing more. It seems once again that Leela is open-minded but not really interested and Fry has added to his list of shallow reasons for liking Leela: lust, loneliness, the excitement of Valentine's Day and now simple teenage hormones (lust again).{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n\n(Why is this wiki so salty about Fry and Leela?

Stop hogging that healthy liver!|Professor Farnsworth}}\n\n'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is episode eleven of [[Season Two]] of ''[[Futurama]]''. It was written by [[Bill Odenkirk]] and guest starred [[Nora Dunn]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\n[[Hermes Conrad]] is excited because the [[Central Bureaucracy]] is conducting an inspection the next day, and he expects to be promoted to a Grade 35 bureaucrat. [[Leela]] hosts a poker game with her former co-workers from [[Applied Cryogenics]] at the office that night, and [[Bender]] cheats via the use of X-ray glasses. Unfortunately, he accidentally gives himself away when he mentions seeing a worm inside Leela's old boss, prompting her co-workers to grab the glasses. On the run from the other players, he takes refuge in Hermes’ office, but the other players find him, and the savage beating he receives trashes the office.\n\nThe mess in his office costs Hermes his promotion, and the inspector, [[Morgan Proctor]], places a suicidal Hermes on paid vacation, &quot;the ultimate penalty&quot;, and appoints herself acting [[Planet Express]] bureaucrat. Dr. [[Zoidberg]] suggests Hermes and his wife [[LaBarbara Conrad|LaBarbara]] take a trip to [[Spa 5]], the sauna planet that gives him a bucket of krill for every patient he sends there. [[Fry]] gains a new title: Executive Delivery Boy.\n\nMorgan Proctor, who has a fetish for slovenly men (in her words, she is &quot;surrounded by neat freaks all the time&quot;), begins a secret affair with Fry (a &quot;dirty, dirty boy!&quot;), while Hermes and his wife discover that Spa 5 is actually a forced labor camp. After Bender discovers the illicit affair, Morgan downloads his personality and intelligence to a disk, turning him into a mindless drone, who can only say &quot;I am Bender, please insert girder.&quot; She also sends the disk off to the Central Bureaucracy for filing.\n\nHermes begins to use his natural managerial skills to reorganize the labor camp for efficiency, oblivious to the torment of his fellow workers. The rest of the Planet Express staff infiltrate the Central Bureaucracy in order to recover Bender’s mind. One of the many employees they encounter is a [[Beholder Monster]], a ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' monster, who simply hopes not to be exposed for sleeping on the job. They discover the master in-pile, an enormous pile of pneumatic tube capsules, only one of which contains Bender’s brain.\n\nThe [[Planet Express crew]] is daunted by the giant pile, but Hermes has returned from Spa 5. He had made the labor camp so efficient that they only needed one [[Australian Man|Australian man]] to perform the labor. In a [[Bureaucrat Song|musical number]], Hermes sorts the master in-pile, recovering the disk with Bender’s personality. Bender says &quot;I'm Bender baby, please insert liquor!&quot;. He is restored to his original rank, a Grade 36 bureaucrat, by the head of the Central Bureaucracy for sorting the master in-pile, but immediately demoted to Grade 38 for finishing two seconds early, something bureaucrats should never do. Since Morgan was still in charge of Planet Express, she fires Fry for exposing her affair. However, Hermes exposes a mistake Morgan made on her high school prom date papers, having stamped it only four times instead of the standard five. [[Number 1.0]] promotes him to grade 37 for this, and in turn, orders his assistants to get the papers needed to have Morgan taken away. The [[Hubert Farnsworth|Professor]] re-hires Hermes, at severely reduced pay, and Fry asks if he can come back at a severely reduced pay as well. Hermes lets him and then gives severely reduced pay for everyone. Zoidberg begins his own musical number but the show immediately ends.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Hermes-isms===\n* ''Sweet gorilla of Manila''\n* ''Sweet somethin' of someplace''\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nAs if relations between Hermes and Zoidberg weren't strained enough, Zoidberg unwittingly recommends to Hermes and La Barbara the forced-labor camp Spa 5 as a vacation getaway. However, the relationship remains complicated: it is Zoidberg who gives them a ride back to Earth from Spa 5, and Hermes happily includes Zoidberg in the performance of the Bureaucrat Song, suggesting that he holds no grudge.\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry has an affair with Bureaucrat Proctor.\n\n===Character Arcs===\nHermes steps into his role as company bureaucrat.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\nWhen Fry is afraid that Bureaucrat Proctor is about to harm him, he claims to be &quot;the other Fry&quot;, the one that's spelled with a p-h.\n== References ==\n&lt;references /&gt;\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Articles in need of a re-write]]\n[[Category:Articles in need of citation]]"

In fact, he does not even dare to stand up to[[ Zapp Brannigan]] when he is being bullied by him. However[[ Kif Kroker]] showed himself taking a stand against[[ Zapp Brannigan]] by punching him hard in the stomach in ''[[The Beast With A Billion Backs]]'' and even disobeying one of [[Zapp Brannigan|Zapp Brannigan's]] orders in ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''. He rarely drinks and smokes and when he is drunk he finds [[Zapp Brannigan|Zapp Brannigan's]] words to be extremely funny.\n\nHe is timid to all beings he meets, with the exception of [[Fry]], who is assigned to be his assistant when the [[Planet Express Crew]] was drafted into the[[War Is The H-Word| War]] on [[Spheron 1]].\n\n== Love Life ==\nHe fell deeply in love with [[Amy Wong]] after they met on the sinking cruise ship the [[Titanic]], but for a long time was unable to express his emotions to her. He would frequently call her on the phone, but he could never get himself to say hello, much less confess his love.\n\nEventually, his attractions for Amy are revealed to her, and much to his surprise reciprocated. Later in the series his love for her becomes so strong she becomes his [[Smizmar]]. While the Smizmar is the one who inspires his breeding cycle, it is found out that [[Turanga Leela]] actually donated the DNA for his spawn, as evidenced by some of them having a single eye. However, in the same scene some two-eyed spawn can also be seen accidentally knocking their heads together, which might hint at Amy's klutzy character and indicate that both Amy and Leela have donated DNA.\n\nDespite being hired as a gigolo in &quot;[[Brannigan Begin Again]]&quot;, he seems to be unaware of what human sex is in &quot;[[Where the Buggalo Roam]]&quot;.\n\nIn ''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]'' he makes Amy his ''[[Fonfon Ru]].'' He is unwilling to take her back after she slept with his commander [[Zapp Brannigan]], noting facetiously that ''Fonfon Ru'' literally translates as &quot;One who does not sleep with my commanding officer.&quot; He even stood up against Zapp Brannigan by punching him in the stomach to get back at him for causing Amy to allegedly cheat on him.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'', Kif along with many other main characters board the [[Planet Express Ship]] as it enters the Wormhole. Amy and Kif are seen hugging, this suggests that they got back together before [[Season 6]], or at the very least still have feelings for each other.\n\nKif and Amy went through a rough patch in &quot;[[Proposition Infinity]]&quot;, thanks to Kif's belief that she was only interested in &quot;bad boys&quot;, and he eventually dumped her. She dated [[Bender]] for the duration of this episode, but got together with Kif at the end.\n\nKif often cries when he is upset about something involving his love for Amy.\n\nIn &quot;[[The Butterjunk Effect]]&quot;, Amy was addicted on [[Nectar]] and constantly abuses Kif who sadly doesn't seem to mind. He became upset whenever he saw Amy Wong kissing [[Fry]]. In the end however, he forgives her after Amy Wong apologizes to him after quitting her Nectar addiction, knowing it was the Nectar that made her attracted to Fry.\n\n== Physiology ==\nAccording to [[Kif Kroker]] in the episode [[Where the Buggalo Roam]], he doesn't have a skeleton of bones. Rather, he's supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders. An example of such is the episode [[Rebirth]] where the rest of the dead crew is seen having skeletons (except for [[Bender Bending Rodriguez|Bender]]) and his body only has organs.\n\nHe has a camouflage reflex that allows him to unconsciously blend into his surroundings when he is surprised, and can also walk on walls and ceilings.\n\n[[Kif Kroker]] has the ability to shed his skin, and appears to wear underwear between his layers of skin, as seen in the episode [[Three Hundred Big Boys]].\n\n[[Kif Kroker]] can also inflate his head to an extremely large size to scare off creatures like the [[Poisonous Froad]], as seen in [[Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch]]. It also can release a buzzing sound akin to a doorbell as seen in [[The Butterjunk Effect]].\n\n[[Kif Kroker]] says he is related to the sea-cucumber in an argument with [[Amy Wong]], who replies &quot;Not where it counts.&quot;\n\n[[Kif Kroker]] has three nipples, as seen in the episode [[Amazon Women in the Mood]].\n\n== Background Notes ==\n*On the commentary for [[Amazon Women in the Mood]], [[Matt Groening]] states that [[Kif Kroker]] is based on 'an annoyed [[Wikipedia:Mr. Spock|Mr. Spock]]'.\n*[[Kif Kroker]] has shown incredible fighting skills as shown while fighting the [[Spiderians]] in [[Three Hundred Big Boys]]).\n*[[Kif Kroker]] is the character who has appeared substantially in the most episodes besides the [[Planet Express Crew|Crew]].\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Episodes ===\n*&quot;''[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[A Flight To Remember]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[When Aliens Attack]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Brannigan, Begin Again]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[The Problem With Popplers|The Problem with Popplers]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[War is the H-Word]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Where The Buggalo Roam]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[A Taste of Freedom]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]&quot;''\n* &quot;''[[Rebirth]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Proposition Infinity]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[That Darn Katz!]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Benderama]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Ghost in the Machines]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Cold Warriors]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Zapp Dingbat]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[The Butterjunk Effect]]&quot; ''\n* &quot;''[[Meanwhile]]&quot;''\n\n=== Specials ===\n* &quot;[[Naturama]]&quot;\n\n=== Movies ===\n* &quot;[[Bender's Big Score]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]&quot;\n[[Category:Planet Express Crew]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Military]]\n[[Category:Main Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Photo Pop Characters]]\n[[Category:Amphibiosan]]\n[[Category:Kroker Family]]"

Fry|Philip]], and copies him in almost any way he can.\n\nBack in the year [[3002]], Fry is getting fed up with his bad luck. In the final blow, he loses nearly all of his money at the racecourse, nearly violently electrocuted trying to hold on to his final dollar and landing in a steel garbage can with leftover hors d'oeuvre being tipped on him. \n[[File:Fryhome.jpg|left|thumb|The Fry family home]]\nIn a flashback, Fry discovers a [[seven leaf clover]], which grants him extraordinary luck and allows him to beat his brother in any contest, from [[basketball]] to breakdancing. Fry sets off, with [[Leela]] and [[Bender]], to find his clover in the ruins of Old New York and makes his way to his old house, which looks the same outside back then and now.\n\nBack in the [[1980s]], a teenage Fry hides the seven-leaf clover inside his [[Ronco record vault]]. In the year 3002, [[Bender]] opens the record vault, but Fry discovers that the clover is missing, concluding that Yancy must have stolen it. They happen across a statue of Yancy, with the seven-leaf clover in his lapel. The inscription: “Philip J. Fry - First person on [[Mars]]” angers Fry because he believes Yancy stole his name and his dream.\n[[File:Orbiting Meadows.jpg|thumb|right|Orbiting Meadows National Cemetery]]\n[[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] pulls up a biographical movie about “[[Philip J. Fry II|Philip J. Fry]],” where the crew learns that he was a millionaire rock star astronaut, and is now buried in [[Orbiting Meadows National Cemetery]] with the seven-leaf clover. A furious Fry sets off to rob the grave and recover the clover. Which Bender goes get his grave robbing kit.\n\nThe story jumps back to the early 21st century, where an adult Yancy is rummaging through his missing brother’s music to find something to play at his upcoming wedding. Yancy discovers the seven-leaf clover in Fry's copy of ''The Breakfast Club'' soundtrack, and takes it.\n\nFry, Leela and Bender reach the grave site in the World Heros section, and start digging. But Fry knocks loose some moss that is covering part of the inscription, and begins to read. The story jumps back to Yancy, who is discussing naming his newborn son with his wife. Yancy didn't steal Fry's clover; instead, he had given it to his newborn son, and named him Philip J. Fry II in memory of his brother. The inscription on the tomb reads “Here Lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle, to carry on his spirit”. Realizing that Yancy had loved and missed him, Fry returns the clover to his nephew’s grave.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*The sign in [[Alienese]] reads, &quot;Not Without My Egg Case: Tonight on Lifetime&quot;.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry asks Leela for a good-luck kiss at the racetrack. She obliges by kissing him on the cheek. He indicates that he wanted to make out with her, but she doesn't respond, and he doesn't pursue the matter. It seems that the feelings he expressed in [[Parasites Lost]] have disappeared entirely and he has returned to experiencing only lust for her. It also seems that Leela doesn't feel any particular sadness over the Fry she lost in that episode.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Three]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

He was a robot actor and celebrity, created sometime before the year 1960 - for a while, he was known as David Duchovney, and then later on as a car manufacturing robot known as Calculon 1.0, who was used on the military mission to manufacture the most evil car ever from evil automobile parts - otherwise known as [[Project Satan]]. Upon its final construction, Project Satan attacked Calculon, turning him into a [[Were-car]].\n\nIn the centuries since becoming a were-car, Calculon changed his identity and upgraded his appearance to avoid suspicion. Other names he has been known by include: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat, and David Duchovny.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Honking]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He was also given his &quot;Un-holy acting talent&quot; from the Robot Devil.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown what he exchanged for this talent, if he exchanged anything at all for it.\n\nCalculon was brutally clamped during the episode &quot;[[The Silence of the Clamps]]&quot; by [[Clamps]], due to his inability to pay the [[Donbot]] back a loan. He died in a reenactment of ''Romeo and Juliet'' in a battle against experienced actor, [[Langdon Cobb]], when he commits suicide by drinking a bottle of food coloring and water in front of a live audience, (food coloring is the most poisonous substance known to robots).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Thief of Baghead]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Acting Career ==\nCalculon is a celebrated actor in his current form, and has appeared on ''Late Night With [[Humorbot 5.0]]''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Bend Her]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and was a judge at the Miss Universe Pageant.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Lesser of Two Evils]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Television ===\nCalculon stars in ''[[All My Circuits]]'', a robot-soap opera in which most of the characters are robots, though some [[human]]s make appearances from time to time. In the show, he is married to a fembot named [[Monique]] and has a son named [[Antonio Calculon]].\n\n=== Film ===\nCalculon was nominated for an Oscar for his performance in ''[[The Magnificent Three]]'', written by [[Harold Zoid]], but didn't win.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[That's Lobstertainment!]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He also starred in the film adaptation for the television program that made him famous, ''[[All My Circuits: The Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Raging Bender]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He also stared in the film dedicated to his soon-to-be wife, Coilette.\n\n== Relationships ==\n[[File:Calculon.png|thumb|Calculon (left) and Bender ''alias'' [[Coilette]] (right)]]\n\n=== With Bender/Coilette ===\nAfter changing his gender and identity to [[Coilette]] so that he could participate in the Female Robot Olympics, [[Bender]] became romantically involved with Calculon. After becoming engaged to Calculon, Coilette &quot;died&quot; during their wedding, thereby ending their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bend Her]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBender is also Calculon's official stalker and hot water heater.&lt;ref&gt;''[[That's Lobstertainment]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn &quot;[[Calculon 2.0]]&quot; we see in his suitcase he had a photo of Coilette showing he still loved her.\n\n== Death ==\nCalculon died tragically in the world acting championship, poisoning himself to increase the realism of poisoning himself in the death scene of Romeo &amp; Juliet. Despite his imbibement of the most deadly poison known to robots (food coloring), he still lost the competition to legendary actor [[Langdon Cobb]]. He did not live to learn of his defeat.\n\nThe Planet Express crew brought Calculon back from the dead (through &quot;science&quot;) in &quot;[[Calculon 2.0]]&quot; so he could star in ''[[All My Circuits]]'' again. However, because of his replacement's popularity, Calculon was considered outdated. He tried to make it big by starring in his own one-man play, but failed because of how boring it was. In the end, however, the Planet Express team did manage to get him a small role on ''All My Circuits'', though he was forced to do a second take (due to his self-impressed attitude getting in the way). During the second take, his acting was believable, and he received a round of applause. Calculon refused to bow, however, believing he didn't deserve it. [[Leela]] insisted, and Calculon took a bow. Unfortunately, the noose he put up for the scene fell, bringing some of the lights down, almost killing Calculon, before the walkway fell onto the robot actor, killing him a second time. In his memory, they put back Calculon's star on the Walk of Fame, and his soul was returned to [[Robot Hell]] (much to the Robot Devil's dismay).\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Calculon considers it a great insult to do second takes when filming as he perceives himself and his acting to do perfect and therefore refuses second takes to be done with his television show [[All My Circuits]] and thats probably why most scenes seem unfinished.\n*At one point, Calculon was trying out directing.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Episodes ===\n* &quot;[[I, Roommate]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Honking]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[That's Lobstertainment!]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Crimes Of The Hot]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Bend Her]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Mother's Day]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Bender's Big Score]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''\n*''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''\n*''[[Bender's Game]]''\n*''[[Into The Wild Green Yonder]]''\n* &quot;[[The Silence of the Clamps]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Yo Leela Leela]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Decision 3012]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Thief of Baghead]]&quot; (Death)\n* &quot;[[Calculon 2.0]]&quot; (Rebirth)\n\n=== Games ===\n* &quot;[[Futurama: The Game]]&quot; (Cameo)\n==Footnotes==\n&lt;references /&gt;\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:League of Robots]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:All My Circuits]]\n[[Category:Television]]"

It was written by [[Eric Kaplan]], and directed by [[Brian Sheesley]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Amy]] and [[Leela]] drag [[Fry]] and [[Bender]] to the gym, and [[Doctor Zoidberg]] tags along. While at the gym, Zoidberg behaves erratically, unusually and aggressively, and even develops a head fin. Back at the laboratory, [[Professor Farnsworth]] examines Zoidberg, whose claws are held shut with rubber bands, and determines that it is mating season for Zoidberg's [[Decapodians|species]].\n\nThe crew flies to Zoidberg's home planet, [[Decapod 10]]. After a short tour, Zoidberg sets up a mound on the beach and begins trying to attract a mate. After an unsuccessful day, Zoidberg meets [[Edna]], an old classmate. She rejects him and Zoidberg leaves depressed and upset.\n\nFry begins teaching Zoidberg how to win Edna's heart using human romance techniques. Using his newfound techniques, Zoidberg successfully woos Edna to a date. While at a restaurant, Leela reveals to Edna that Fry is responsible for the change in Zoidberg making her fall in love with Fry.\n\nUnder the pretext of discussing Zoidberg, Edna invites Fry to her apartment and begins an unsuccessful attempt at seducing him much to Fry's horror. Zoidberg walks in, sees them embracing, starts to think that Fry has double crossed Zoidberg by sweeping Edna off her feet. Fry tries to deny it though Edna (while smothering fry with her breasts), confirms it by saying she wants to mate with Fry the next day. Zoidberg gets angry and challenges Fry to [[Claw-Plach]], a ritual fight to the death. Edna states if he survives they'll make sweet love which causes Fry to scream uncontrollably. \n[[File:Futurama 209 - Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love .jpg|thumb|right|Fry and Zoidberg fight to the death during Claw-Plach]] In the arena, Fry is about to defeat Zoidberg, but cannot kill his friend. Unfortunately, Zoidberg doesn't feel the same way and cuts Fry's arm off with his claw, prompting Fry to curse Zoidberg before proceeding to beat him with his severed arm. After more fighting, Fry and Zoidberg look up to discover the entire Decapodian audience has left, including Edna who has decided to mate with the [[Decapodian Emperor|emperor]]. Once every Decapodian is underwater, masses of eggs float to the surface; Zoidberg has missed the mating frenzy of his species. They soon witness the corpses of all the Decapodians float to the surface, where they are feasted on by seagulls. Zoidberg explains that members of his species die after mating and apologizes to Fry about how he acted. He felt things he never felt before: &quot;love, jealousy, and passion for disemboweling&quot;. He then tries to reattach Fry's arm but he attaches it on the wrong side. Trying again, he saws off the legs. For the last try it is presumed, since there is no scream of pain audible, that he beheads Fry.\n\nThe episode owes much to the September 17, 1967 &quot;Amok Time&quot; episode of ''Star Trek: The Original Series'' in which Mr. Spock returns to his homeworld Vulcan for a brutal Vulcan mating ritual.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\nFry loses his right arm in the Claw-Plach battle with Zoidberg. Back at Planet Express, Zoidberg reattaches the arm but on the wrong side.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Articles in need of a re-write]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Farnsworth}}\n\n'''Hubert J. Farnsworth''' (born April 9, 2841), better known as '''Professor Farnsworth''' or the '''Professor''', is the proprietor of the [[Planet Express]] delivery service. He is pushing the limits of even the 31st century at an agе of well over 160.\n\nProfessor Farnsworth is one of six living relatives of [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]], together with his own clone, [[Cubert]], as well as his only son by means of his sexual relations with [[Mom]] while he worked for her, [[Igner]]. He has a brother named [[Floyd]], also his parents are still alive. He is Fry's nephew thirty times over. Though never stated, he is therefore logically the descendant of Fry's only sibling, [[Yancy Fry, Jr]]. However, since it is revealed that Fry is his own grandfather, and therеfore Yancy's grandfather, due to his time-traveling exploits, Professor Farnsworth is logically in fact Fry's direct descendant via his brother/grandson Yancy. So the six include: himself, Cubert, Igner, Floyd, [[Velma Farnsworth|Velma]] and [[Ned Farnsworth]].\n\n==Biography==\nProfessor Farnsworth is a senile, deranged, and unpredictable old man who is both a maniac and a genius who was born in prison as mentioned in &quot;[[Overclockwise]]&quot;. He has a gift and passion for the creation of [[Doomsday Device]]s and [[Atomic Supermen]], and is a danger to himself, his employees, and the [[Universe]] in general. He has put at least one [[parallel universe]] in peril with his inventions.\n\nWhen he was a teenager he was put in a mental institute but got out 25 years later. Professor Farnsworth formerly worked for [[Mom's Friendly Robot Company]] and taught at [[Mars University (location)|Mars University]]. He currently spends the majority of his time inventing ridiculous devices and coming up with equally ridiculous and suicidal missions for his crew members.\n\n==Abilities==\nFarnsworth's greatest ability is his exceptional intelligence; however, it is hampered by his senility. He does have more unusual &quot;abilities&quot; though: Since Fry's existence is cyclical, and being part of Fry's bloodline, Farnsworth himself is an anomaly in the universe. Also, ever since &quot;[[The Late Philip J. Fry]]&quot;, Farnsworth has become an out-of-universe observer. It is unknown how this may manifest itself in the future, but logically nothing that happens as a result of time travel in the current universe can affect him, since he is not a part of this universe.\n\nFor some unexplained reason, his eyes are never seen. There are only two episodes in which he has ever taken his glasses off. In the episode &quot;[[Mother's Day]]&quot;, he is shown from the side when he does it, and Mom comments &quot;Your eyes were always such a beautiful shade of... milky white.&quot; (still not giving away the specific color of his eyes). In the episode &quot;[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]&quot;, he removes his glasses after Fry mistakenly states that Zoidberg is dead (though the &quot;corpse&quot; is only Zoidberg's empty shell) but promptly covers his eyes with his hand in order to sob.\n\n==Catchphrases==\nProfessor Farnsworth is characterized by his catch-phrase &quot;[[Good news, everyone!]]&quot; frequently followed by very bad news; often one of his semi-suicidal missions. Another is his exclamation of surprise, &quot;Sweet [[Zombie Jesus]]!&quot;, which is noted to be clumsily censored on some networks. Also, though not a catchphrase in general, he often says &quot;Wha?&quot; when unaware of the situation, or when someone questions a statement he has just made, showing his senility. Also, he often completely contradicts himself; he told his crew they were to gather &quot;ordinary honey. Just ordinary honey.&quot; When one of his crew asked about the mission, he suddenly turned serious and said &quot;This is no ordinary honey!&quot; Another catchphrase he uses is &quot;...Wernstrom!&quot;, which he says whenever he sees [[Professor Wernstrom]], his scientific rival, and &quot;Well I am already in my pajamas.....&quot;\n\n==Age==\nProfessor Farnsworth's amazingly advanced age manifests itself in senility and general physical decrepitude. While generally friendly, he is sometimes prone to sudden fits of bitter contempt for random things. The Professor is also known for his inclination toward exhibitionism and does not hesitate to appear naked in public, stating that, like pine trees and poodles, the &quot;primitive notions of modesty&quot; of the 20th century are long gone. He also mentions that, being 160-years-old, he is old enough to rent and purchase &quot;ultra-porn&quot;. Beyond that, the professor's occasional brief verbal digressions about his own life imply a somewhat colorful sexual past, which he often concludes with a nostalgic &quot;Ah, yes...&quot;. He also mentions in ''[[Bender's Game]]'' that people sometimes call him &quot;The Catman&quot; for his ability to land perfectly on his feet after falling from a high balcony.\n\n[[File:Futurama TMLH.jpg|thumb|left|Professor Farnsworth in [[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]], as an artificially induced 37.5 years old]]\n\nProfessor Farnsworth is the oldest human being living on earth (excluding those who have been cryogenically frozen or are kept alive as heads in jars), a title he acquired upon turning 160. At this age, all humans are collected by the [[Sunset Squad Robots]] and sent to live out the rest of their days in isolation aboard the gigantic [[Near Death Star]]. After his crew rescues him, Farnsworth returns to Planet Express to resume the life he originally had before being removed by the Sunset Robot Squad. After swimming in the Fountain of Aging, reports that he is &quot;Even older! Huzzahhh!&quot;.\n\nAlthough being in his 160s, in Leela's dreamworld in the episode &quot;[[The Sting]]&quot;, the Professor became quite shocked when Fry, who was technically 1025-years-old after being frozen for a millennium, accidentally died, remarking, &quot;This makes me the oldest living member of my family!&quot; and burst into tears at this realization. This is contradicted when we later learn that both of his parents are still alive in the 7th season episode &quot;[[Near-Death Wish]]&quot;. However this may be becuase the Professor loathed his parents(&quot;[[Near-Death Wish]]&quot;) and tries to ignore their existence.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Relationship with his crew===\nProfessor Farnsworth rarely worries about the safety of the crew, viewing them as a means to an end. After remarking that he was looking for a new crew for his intergalactic space ship, he was asked &quot;what happened to your old crew?&quot; His response was &quot;Oh, those poor sons of b...but that's not important! What is important is that I need a new crew!&quot; When Fry, Bender and Leela state that they have no [[career chip]]s, he produces them from a bag labeled &quot;Contents of Space Wasp's Stomach&quot;. He quite frequently sends them on dangerous missions even when he has the foreknowledge that they will probably not make it back alive. His missions are typically those other delivery companies won't take, such as delivering subpoenas to mob-controlled worlds or casual deliveries to virus-infested planets. Even the commercial that he had produced for his company makes several remarks to this effect, including, &quot;When other companies aren't crazy or foolhardy enough...&quot; and &quot;our crew is expendable, your package isn't&quot;, the former showing the crewman running through a minefield and the latter a crewman being dragged away by a giant bird. When the crew and his ship are sent off to war, he immediately tries to hire another crew. When his old crew returns, he is clearly surprised they survived, remarking, &quot;Oh God you're alive! I mean, thank God you're alive,&quot; then remarks to the applicants, &quot;Come back in three days. A week at the most&quot; indicating just how low he thinks their chances of survival are. When the crew was sent to retrieve space honey they found the remains of the previous [[Planet Express ship]] buried in the hive's honey. Even his family relationship to Fry doesn't do much, if anything, to reduce his ardor for particularly difficult and deadly delivery missions. His relationship is closest to Zoidberg who he values a good long time friend although Farnsworth is a speciesist. He employed Zoidberg because Farnsworth once saved his life from a yeti and at this time, Farnsworth was infected with Yetiism, which he mistook for hypermalaria. He made Zoidberg promise to mercy kill Farnsworth so he would not die of it and therefore Zoidberg was employed by Farnsworth for the sole purpose of carrying out this task. This promise was kept a secret and many lies and cover ups were made until the rest of the crew found out the truth.\n\n===Relationship with Mom===\nWhile at [[MomCorp]], he fell in love with the CEO, [[Mom]]. [[Igner]] was born of this relationship. Farnsworth left Mom and MomCorp when she decided to weaponize his [[Q. T. McWhiskers]] toy, an anthropomorphic cat toy that shot rainbows from its eyes.\n\nHe and [[Mom]] have had continued relations since this time. In a plot to retrieve the [[Universal Robot Controller]] from Mom's bra, the Professor brings flowers to Mom's cabin in The Bronx where their love is rekindled ending in a &quot;whirlwind of hot, dry sex&quot;. After learning of the plot Mom subsequently dumps him.\n\n'''Robosexual Relationship'''\n\nIn the episode, Proposition Infinity, the professor reveals he met a girl by the name of Eunice, whom he fell in love with. After dating for 40 years, she cheated on him with a robot. Later in the episode he reveals that Eunice's true name was Unit 47, revealing that he is a robosexual and explaining his hate for them.\n\n==Personality==\nThough knowledgeable and prodigious inventor, Professor Farnsworth is also plagued by intermittent senility. In contrast to his endearingly inept persona, and while he's generally friendly mild-mannered, he has several negative character traits. These include arrogance, spitefulness, and a general disregard towards his employees and, at times, a tendency towards [[Wikipedia:Speciesism#In fiction|speciesism]], especially towards Cygnoids. Being a scientist, Farnsworth is an active defender of scientific progress and education, and is prone to be aggressive towards anyone who express esoteric or religious viewpoints that contradicts his own opinion, as evident in &quot;[[The Thief of Baghead]]&quot; when he angrily claimed that life-force isn't the same as an ethereal soul (though he seems to not known the difference between one another, if any), and in &quot;[[A Clockwork Origin]]&quot;, Farnsworth claimed that anyone that believes in creaturism over evolution to be ignorant, and went as far as to leave [[Earth]] when they refused to listen and see his theories and archaeological evidences. Despite this, Farnsworth is far from being Atheist. Rather, his spiritual faith seems to change from episode to episode, but (and peharps due to it) is generally a liberal one. In &quot;[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]&quot;, when one of his experiments goes awry and nearly killed him, he starts to desperately scream for help and shouts to several deities of different religions to do so, at one time asking Satan to save him because he owes him one, in another episode, he says &quot;Hail Science&quot; with 666 across his forehead. In [[Hell Is Other Robots]], Farnsworth claimed that Vodoo and Oprahism are mainstream religions and expresses interest in them. In &quot;[[Möbius Dick]]&quot;, when he comes to the conclusion that his crew has died on their mission, he decided to pray to Isis.\n\nAlso, Farnsworth has shown tendencies for nudism in &quot;[[Near-Death Wish]]&quot; when the Professor yells at his parents, then proceeds to strip and run through the city naked. This is expanded on in &quot;[[Anthology of Interest I]] by Hermes: &quot;Let's see, Citation for public nudity, Conspiracy to commit public nudity...&quot;\n\n==Family Tree==\n\n Mr. Gleisner──┬──Mrs. Gleisner      [[Philip J.

He is also the descendants of Philo Farnsworth.\n*Professor Farnsworth has the same blood type as [[Amy Wong]] (which is the reason he likes keeping her around).\n*He has a &quot;Thug Life&quot; tattoo on his back, based on a tattoo that rapper Tupac Shakur had during his career.\n*His middle initial, &quot;J&quot;, is the same as several of [[Matt Groening]]'s other creations, [[w:c:simpsons:Homer Simpson|Homer J. Simpson]], [[w:c:simpsons:Bart Simpson|Bartholomew J. Simpson]], and [[w:c:simpsons:Abe Simpson|Abraham J. Simpson]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', as well as his own distant relative, [[Philip J. Fry]]. It is currently unknown what Hubert's middle name is.\n*He [[Wikipedia:Theistic Satanism|religiously]] invokes the name of Satan on a regular basis; his counterpart in Universe 1 proclaims the Bible to be the &quot;real good news&quot;, suggesting he decided his religion on a coin flip (as the outcome of coin flips is the difference between the Universes).\n*According to him, Satan, Zeus, Buddha, and Jesus all owe him one.\n*He has had multiple relationships with Carol (much better known as [[Mom]]), who he had left and gone back to three times.\n*He taught himself to read while he was still in diapers, at about 8 years old.\n*He must be the oldest man on [[Earth]], except for those who have been cryogenically frozen or preserved as heads in jars. In &quot;[[A Clone of My Own]]&quot; it is revealed that everyone is collected at the age of 160 and taken to the [[Near Death Star]] except for him (due to certain events in that episode).\n*The character Professor Putricide in the popular game ''World of Warcraft'' is largely based on him. Putricide says such lines as &quot;Just an ordinary gas cloud..... but watch out, that's no ordinary gas cloud!&quot; and &quot;Good news everyone! I think I've developed a plague that will destroy all life on Azeroth!&quot;.\n*His favorite Christmas tradition is streaking in the New New York City streets.\n*When he was a century and a half younger, he kept a mouse's head stitched on a frog's body as a pet, before it was carried away and probably eaten by an eagle.\n* He resembles to [[w:c:simpsons:Jonathan Frink|Jonathan Frink]] who is a Professor from ''The Simpsons''.\n* The Professor has no overall Business Plan for [[Planet Express]].\n* The Professor's bad vision is the result of a botched laser-eye operation (though the Professor is unaware of this).\n* Hubert J. Farnsworth is uncircumcised, as indicated by the quote spoken by bender in &quot;[[Near-Death Wish]]&quot; where Bender says &quot;That is one crazy uncircumcised old man.&quot;.\n\n==Gallery==\n&lt;gallery&gt;\nProfessor-farnsworth.jpg\nPhiloFarnsworth.png\n250px-TheFarnsworthParabox.jpg\nFarns1.png|[[Alternate Farnsworth]]\nFarnsworthAndMomBreakUp.jpg\nFarnsworthstranslator.png\nFarnsworthkillbots.jpg\nFarnsworthhead.png\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n[[Category:Planet Express Crew]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Fry family]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Main Characters]]"

Using the ruthless 80's business tactics, he applied a new business stratagem that focused more on reworking the image of Planet Express than on actually delivering packages. Although Planet Express, rebranded &quot;PlanEx inc.&quot;, actually was less productive under the leadership of That Guy, he was successful in convincing the competition that they were a serious competitor and he agreed to sell the company to [[MomCorp]]'s delivery branch so [[Mom]] could gut the company and eliminate it as a competitor. But the resurgence of That Guy's [[boneitis]], allowed Fry to stop the takeover and control of the company returned to the Professor.\n\n===Awesome Express===\nIn an effort to gain the respect of their fathers, [[Dwight Conrad]] and [[Cubert Farnsworth]] started their own &quot;delivery&quot; company, [[Awesome Express]]. Although [[Hermes Conrad]] and Farnsworth were unimpressed at first, their minds were changed when Awesome Express began making more money than Planet Express, and the boys eventually bought out their fathers' company to expand their paper delivering enterprise.\n\nHowever, Dwight and Cubert were unable to keep up with the rapidly increasing responsibilities, and were eventually forced to seek the help of their fathers, who then regained control of Planet Express.\n\n===The Nudist Alien Scammers===\nAfter Farnsworth is scammed out of control his company by internet [[Nudist Alien Scammers|scammers]], Planet Express is transformed into a base from which, the scammers eventually scammed control of [[Earth]] itself from the government. It is assumed that the scammers disbanded the company after it gained control of the planet, and proceeded to evict all Earthicans from it, but continued using the [[Planet Express building]] as their headquarters. When the combined forces of Earth (and several other planets) liberated their homeworld, Planet Express was once again in the delivery business.\n\n== See Also ==\n*[[Planet Express building]]\n*[[Planet Express ship]]\n*[[Planet Express crew]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Logos]]"

It originally aired in North America on November 21, 1999.\n\n[[File:MundaMorris.gif|thumb|Turanga Morris and Munda make an appearance before we learn who they are!]]\n== Plot ==\nWhen [[Nibbler]] has a 5th birthday party, [[Bender]] becomes annoyed that he is getting more attention than him. Having reluctantly made a birthday cake for Nibbler, Bender is aghast to see Nibbler gobble it all up before everybody else can praise Bender for the cake. In extreme annoyance, Bender flushes the animal down the toilet. [[Leela]] is distraught at the loss of her pet and angered by Bender's inability to understand the emotions of others. [[Professor Farnsworth]] proposes a solution: installing an empathy chip in Bender's head that will cause him to feel other people's emotions. After forcibly installing the chip, the chip is tuned to pick up Leela's emotions, so that whatever feelings Leela experiences, Bender is forced to experience as well.\n\nAfter a night of experiencing Leela's feelings, Bender misses Nibbler so much that he cannot stand it. When [[Fry]] tells him that alligators can supposedly live after being flushed, Bender flushes himself down the toilet in pursuit of Nibbler. Fry and Leela enter the sewers and quickly manage to find Bender. Unfortunately, they also find a crowd of mutants who live in the sewers. (Among them, Leela's mother, Turanga Munda, as by this point David X. Cohen and Matt Groening had planned her future) The mutants introduce them to their subterranean civilization. They also reveal that a monster called [[El Chupanibre]] has been terrorizing them.\n\nLeela, thinking that Nibbler is the monster, is happy until she is informed that the only way to lure the monster out is to offer a sacrifice in the form of a virgin. Although not one herself (owing to the events of [[Love's Labors Lost in Space|an earlier episode]]), Leela is the closest thing to a virgin there and is therefore forced to be the sacrifice. At the sacrifice, Nibbler emerges from a pipe - but so does a large, reptilian monster, who is the real El Chupanibre. Fry gets entangled in the trap that was meant for El Chupanibre, leaving only Bender to fight the beast. However, Leela is so scared, for herself and the others, that Bender is immobilized by her emotions. He and Fry teach Leela to stop caring about other people and care only about herself, and as a result, Bender is able to fight off the beast, whom he eventually flushes down a giant toilet into the [[sub-sewers]].\n[[File:El chupanibre.jpg|thumb|right|Bender faces off against El Chupanibre.]]\nThe Professor removes Bender's empathy chip. He says in amazement that the chip was actually turned off, so that Bender was actually sympathizing for Leela by himself. He then corrects himself, saying that it was actually at triple capacity (&quot;And I still barely felt anything!&quot; Bender claims.) Bender still retains his 'in-your-face' attitude; meanwhile, Leela learns that adopting Bender's attitude is better than being nice.\n\n==Themes==\nIn this episode, the stage is set for the long period in the relationship between Fry and Leela during which he openly expresses his feelings for her and she rejects him out of hand.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Articles in need of a re-write]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Leela tries to turn them away, but [[Professor Farnsworth]] decides hiring Brannigan would be good for the company's public image.\n\nThe augmented crew is sent to deliver pillows to a hotel on [[Stumbos IV]], a high-gravity planet. Despite Leela's order to deliver one at a time, [[Fry]], [[Bender]], and Zapp decide to deliver all the pillows at once, which in the intense gravity causes the hover dolly to collapse. As punishment, Leela orders them to deliver the pillows by hand, which causes resentment among the crew.\n\nFry, Bender, and Zapp stage a mutiny against Leela, and lock her in the 'laundry brig'. Brannigan decides to attack the [[Neutral Planet]], thinking this will make him a hero and get him reinstated as a DOOP captain. When Fry and Bender discover the plan is a suicide mission, they abandon Brannigan and free Leela; and she retakes command.\n\nAfter returning to Earth, Leela, wanting [[DOOP]] to reinstate him and out of her life, testifies that Brannigan was an amazing hero.\n\nAt the end, while Fry and Bender are cleaning the Planet Express ship,&amp;nbsp;they apologize to Leela&amp;nbsp;and she decides to let them take a break knowing they appreciate her, but the professor overules this so the three decide to mutiny against him.\n\n==Themes==\nAlthough in previous episodes Fry has mentioned his feelings for Leela, he hasn't taken himself off the market yet. In this episode he makes a move on an Amazon woman at the DOOP ribbon-cutting ceremony.\n&lt;references/&gt;\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Articles in need of a re-write]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

It was written by [[J. Stewart Burns]], and directed by [[Bret Haaland]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe election race for [[President of Earth]] is in full swing, with two clones as candidates and the [[Planet Express crew]] registers to vote. Meanwhile, a mining disaster on Titan sends the price of titanium through the roof, and [[Bender]] seizes the opportunity to make a quick buck by pawning his 40% titanium body.\n\nAs a head with a pile of cash, Bender begins enjoying his new lifestyle. During a trip to the Hall of Presidents in the [[New New York]] [[Head Museum]], [[Richard Nixon]]'s head ruins Bender's illusions about the glamor of a life without a body. He feels further guilty when he dreams of ones and zeroes (and a two). He concludes that it means that he shouldn't have sold his body. The next day Bender heads off to the pawn shop to retrieve his body, but it has been sold. The pawnshop owner offers Bender fifty dollars for Fry, but Fry says that his clothes are worth fifty bucks, and the owner says deal. Later at Planet Express, Bender, Leela &amp; Fry, who is stripped from his clothing, even his underwear, watch TV, only to discover that Nixon's head announces its candidacy for President of Earth, using Bender's body to escape a constitutional provision that &quot;no''body ''can be elected more than twice&quot;. \n[[File:AHeadinthePolls.png|thumb|right| &quot;No ''body'' can be elected more than twice.&quot;]]\n[[Fry]], [[Leela]], and Bender take off to [[Washington, D.C.]] to stop Nixon and recover Bender's body. Directly confronting Nixon fails to recover Bender's body, so the crew infiltrates Nixon's room at the Watergate Hotel, where anyone gets a discount if they been there before. Leela successfully separates the sleeping head from the robot body, but Fry accidentally wakes Nixon when he accidentally activates a thought-sensitive massage bed. Confronting the intruders, Nixon begins ranting about his future plans for [[Earth]]. However, Bender records the conversation and knowing that the tape would ruin his election chances if released, Nixon trades the body for the tape.\n\nOn election day, Nixon wins by a single vote after Leela and Fry forget to vote against him. The episode ends with Nixon -- who now has the body of an enormous war robot -- inexplicably rampaging through Washington, D.C., as Secret Service agents escort him into the [[White House]].\n\n==Themes==\nAt the beginning of the episode, Fry and Bender sit on the couch watching &quot;The Scary Door&quot;.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Head in the Polls, A}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Articles in need of a re-write]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

He is afraid to make mistakes, as this may demote him to a lower grade.\n\n== Career ==\n=== Limbo career ===\nHermes was once a professional [[limbo]]er and took part in the Olympics in this evеnt. His main rival was [[Barbados Slim]], another Caribbean limboer. Hermes stopped limboing when a young boy tried to be &quot;just like Hermes&quot; and broke his back (and presumably died) trying to limbo under a tiny gap.\n\nIn [[3004]], Hermes took part in the [[3004 Olympics|Olympics]] and cheated in Olympic Limbo by using the [[Flabo Dynamic Suit]] which shifted all of his body fat towards his knees. The suit ripped and Hermes lost out to Barbados Slim.\n\nHe entered the Olympics the next time and won.\n\n===Bureaucracy===\nAs a young man, Hermes was employed as a robot inspector at a robot factory in Tijuana. Several years before the start of the series he chose to mark a newly built [[Bender]] as fully functional, despite the newborn robot lacking a wireless backup module. He then resigned from Mom's Robot Company and moved to New New York, where he joined the Central Bureaucracy, eventually being assigned to Planet Express. \n\nHermes started as a Grade 34 bureaucrat when his grade was first revealed. He is the accountant for [[Planet Express]] and a long time friend of Professor [[Farnsworth]]. He is proud to be a bureaucrat and has even organized [[Spa 5]], a forced labor camp, to be worked on by one [[Australian Man]]. He sorted out the [[Master In-Pile]] in less than 4 minutes, but he was demoted to grade 38 for being two seconds early. He was then promoted to grade 37 for pointing out that [[Morgan Proctor]] had only stamped a form 4 times, not 5. \n   \nAccording to Hermes in ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'' he is now a bureaucrat grade 34 though in &quot;[[Lethal Inspection]]&quot;, he is shown to be back at grade 36 for unknown reasons. It is also shown in this episode he was once a robot inspector for one of Mom's robot factories in Tijuana as inspector 5. He is also the inspector who approved Bender as he came off the assembly line even though Bender had a defect in which he had no backup unit installed. Bender's cuteness won over Hermes sense of duty and he approved him. He then resigned from the factory a short time after.\n\n==Family==\nHermes has a wife, [[LaBarbara Conrad]], and a son, [[Dwight Conrad]]. His wife left him a couple of times, twice for Barbados Slim when Hermes lost his body. He stopped his son from smoking one of his cigars, which was probably marijuana, and has also set up an organization, [[Fathers Against Rude Television]] to protect his son from [[Bender]]'s bad habits on ''[[All My Circuits]]''. Hermes mentioned his grandmother is deceased in [[The Farnsworth Parabox]]. Later on he mentions his mother is deceased in [[Time Keeps on Slippin']] causing Professor Farnsworth to comment on her being promiscuous. In [[The Beast with a Billion Backs]], Hermes stated his mother and father told him how he would never get attacked by a tentacle monster.\n\n==Personality==\nHermes is a friendly and hard working man for Planet Express. That is the case for a top bureaucrat like him. However he is very nasty, mean and abusive to people like [[Doctor Zoidberg]]. He is in fact a bully and a total jerk to Zoidberg and does very selfish and cruel things to him like cutting Zoidberg's paychecks for no reason and attempting to fire Zoidberg all the time. He can occasionally be sensitive however, such as when he saved a young Bender. Hermes has a dream of winning the Olympic Gold medal for limbo and his archrival is Barbados Slim. He also seems to dislike all his coworkers, with the possible exception of [[Fry]] and [[Leela]].\n\n===Hatred of Dr. Zoidberg===\nHermes is known for his cold and pure hatred to Zoidberg and started showing it in &quot;[[Hell Is Other Robots]]&quot; when he blamed Zoidberg for hogging up electricity when it was actually Bender who was doing it. Even Zoidberg is clueless as to why Hermes hates him and despite trying to be polite and caring for Hermes, Hermes is very rude and disrespectful to him. It is implied multiple times that Hermes hates Zoidberg simply because Zoidberg is a [[Decapodian]] as Hermes frequently calls Zoidberg a &quot;Filthy Crab&quot;, which may be taken as a racial slur. Here are the implications on why Hermes hates Zoidberg from Hermes point of view:\n\n*Zoidberg is an incompetent and pathetic doctor who usually messes up on his procedures with humans.\n\n*He smells bad, both due to his living habits and [[Stench and Stenchibility|his musk.]]\n\n*He has the habit of eating endangered animal species cluelessly..\n\n*He frequently steals Hermes' lunch.\n\n*He comes from a planet that is known for an un-democratic government.\n\n*He once ate the [[Earthican]] Flag Old Freebie, which Earth viewed as desecration.\n\n*He is a coward who runs away from everything scary and violent.\n\n*He usually cannot find a pure and committed relationship with women.\n\n*He has shown sexual confusion to human men.\n\n*He eats toilet paper from the bathroom.\n\n*He overreacts to certain things and frequently falls for anything that he is tricked on.\n\n*Zoidberg supports Hermes' arch nemesis, Barbados Slim during the Olympics when he should be cheering for Hermes.\n\nZoidberg is ignorantly oblivious to this hatred and believes that he and Hermes are the closest of friends even when it is obvious they aren't. In ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'' when Fry is reading people's minds, he hears Hermes and says &quot;You said it; he is pathetic but loveable&quot;, showing that he might not truly hate Zoidberg but finds him somewhat amusing in a way. In &quot;[[The Six Million Dollar Mon]]&quot; when Hermes starts to customize himself into a cyborg and eventually leaves Planet Express, Zoidberg is disappointed and slaps Bender for making fun of Hermes leaving.\n\nWhen Leela and Amy pointed out that Hermes hated Zoidberg, the doctor replied Hermes had a sense of cruel humor and that Hermes is his &quot;best friend&quot;. Later on, Zoidberg makes a puppet with Hermes' skin and spend most of the day playing with it until he revives Hermes by placing the brain back in the puppet. LaBarbara (Hermes' wife) tells Hermes to thank Zoidberg but he is hesitant as he hates him but is forced to anyway. During his thanks, he reveals his contempt for the crustecean and how he never liked him. Finally seeing that the others were right, the doctor gets his revenge on Hermes for all the years of abuse by revealing to Hermes his feelings: &quot;Ouch! What a zinger. Well here's one for you Mr. not-my friend-Conrad. You acted like a big jerk. You were selfish and stupid, and you don't deserve a wife like LaBarbara or a friend like me.&quot; This stunned Hermes, who was left to watch in shock but smiling as Zoidberg, who stood up to him for the first time, left the room in joy at having ended Hermes' abuse.\n\n==Additional Information==\n*In the comic book issue [[Bender Breaks Out]] it was revealed that Hermes was born in 2959, which makes him in his early 50's.\n\n*Hermes is shown to be obese in several episodes, when it is revealed that he has a baby like skeleton with the rest of him being pure fat excluding the organs.\n\n*A holographic Hermes was once attacked by a real pigeon, resulting in the real Hermes appearing in bandages in the next scene (&quot;[[Fear of a Bot Planet]]&quot;).\n\n*During a limbo party in ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'' he lost his body and [[LaBarbara Conrad]] and his son to [[Barbados Slim]].\n\n*He used to work for Mom's Robot Company along with Farnsworth and Zoidberg, and was Bender's quality control inspector. Despite having worked at Mom's Friendly Robot Company prior to Bender's birth in 2997, resigning after falsifying Bender's approval report, he is shown to have been Employee of the Year at Planet Express a number of years from as early as 2992 (Prisoner of Benda). He is also shown to be at his 'current' appearance in these Employee of the Year photos, despite appearing significantly younger in 2997 at Mom's Friendly Robot Company.\n\n*Without Hermes decision in &quot;Lethal Inspection&quot;, Bender would never technically have existed in the first place.\n\n*Befitting a Jamaican stereotype, Hermes seems to be an avid marijuana smoker. He tried to buy hemp from Thomas Jefferson, and when Amy and Bender tried to legalize robosexual marriage, he hinted that he also wanted to legalize pot. In &quot;[[Anthology of Interest I]]&quot;, after finding the professor murdered, he planned to call the police after he &quot;flushed some things&quot;. In &quot;[[Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television]]&quot;, after catching Dwight smoking one of his cigars, Hermes said &quot;That's not a cigar... and it's not mine!&quot;. In &quot;[[T.: The Terrestrial]]&quot;, after finding out how strong Omicronian marijuana is, he quickly sent the team to go collect the plant on Omicron Persei 8 after admitting he wasn't crazy enough to send them there, when omicronians were coming by, he screamed &quot;Five O Five O!!!&quot; meaning he's done something similar to this before.\n\n*Hermes has shown apathy towards the crew's safety at least a couple of times during the episode &quot;[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]&quot;.\n\n*When Hermes or someone else destroys a piece of equipment anytime and does not want to be paying for it, he usually frames Zoidberg for it. This is shown when Leela destroys the roof of Planet Express with the ship and Hermes says &quot;That's comin' out of your pay&quot; to Zoidberg, which reduces him to tears.\n\n*A running gag in several episodes Hermes was shown to be eating a sandwich. Sometime later it is taken or destroyed by Fry, Bender, or Zoidberg, causing Hermes to yell, &quot;My manwich!&quot; It is shown that his son does this also.\n\n*When he once fired Bender and Fry in case they die in a pointless war, he stuck his fist in his teeth and acted rather worried, which could mean he is frightened if a vital employee is fired.\n\n*Hermes also seems to dislike Nibbler in &quot;[[The Deep South]]&quot;, as he claimed he would like to &quot;Stuff him in a sack, throw the sack into the river, and hurl the river into space&quot;\n*He seems to have a talent for piano based instruments, he has been seen playing the pipe organ and the keyboard several times.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n&lt;gallery&gt;\n250px-Hermes conrad.png|Hermes Conrad Artwork\nHermes.jpg|Hermes as a robot.\nHermeszoid-1.png\nHermes at the 2980 Olympics.png|Hermes in the olympics in 2980\nFuturama 214 - How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back.jpg\nHermeshead.png\nHermes and Bender.jpg|Hermes and Bender\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n{{Wikipedia}}\n\n{{MainCharacters}}\n[[Category:Planet Express Crew]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Main Characters]]\n[[Category:Photo Pop Characters]]\n[[Category:Bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Conrad Family]]"

    "title": "Suicide booth",
    "text": "[[File:Suicidebooth.png|right|200px|thumb|A suicide booth.]]\n'''Suicide booths''' are booths found on nearly every street in the year [[3000]]. They are roughly the same size as a phone booth. When in use, a sign above the entrance lights up. They showcase the light attitude towards death in the 31st century.\n\nSuicide booths were invented somewhere between 2006 and [[2008]]. Since 2008, America's most important brand of suicide booths is Stop'n'Drop. Stop'n'Drop suicide booths have three modes of death: &quot;quick and painless&quot;, &quot;slow and horrible&quot;, which is apparently synonymous with &quot;collect call&quot;, and &quot;clumsy bludgeoning&quot;. A suicide in a suicide booth usually costs 25 cents.\n==Trivia==\n*Suicide booths give receipts for suicides even though the person dies.\n*[[Philip_J._Fry|Fry]] met [[Bender_Bending_Rodriguez|Bender]] after mistaking a suicide booth for a phone booth. Bender attempted to use the booth to kill himself after he realized that all the metal he was bending was to be used in suicide booths.\n*Even though Suicide Booths were said to be invented in 2007, they do not exist in the real world (for obvious reasons).\n[[File:Lynn.png|thumb|200px|Lynn, a suicide booth.]]\n*In a contrast to the first episode of Futurama, Bender steps into an actual phone booth in [[Lethal Inspection]], which Hermes mistakes for a Suicide booth, Hermes is both surprised and impressed by the phone booth, and proceeds to throw his cell phone away.\n*The same happens in [[Futurama: Bender's Big Score]] when Bender decides to kill himself after losing Fry in the year 2000 when tasked by the scammers to go back in time and kill Fry. After realizing that it was a phone booth, Bender remarks: &quot;What kind of horrible suicide free time is this?&quot;\n*Suicide Booths appear in [[Futurama: The Game|Futurama: the Game]] during the New New York Levels. The player can in fact make Fry interact with the object, unsurprisingly causing immediate death.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*&lt;i&gt;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&lt;/i&gt;\n*&lt;i&gt;[[Xmas Story]]&lt;/i&gt; {{C|mentioned only}}\n*&lt;i&gt;[[The Lesser of Two Evils]]&lt;/i&gt; {{C|mentioned only}}\n*&lt;i&gt;[[Mother's Day]]&lt;/i&gt;\n*&lt;i&gt;[[Bender's Big Score]]&lt;/i&gt; {{C|mentioned only}}\n*&lt;i&gt;[[The Beast With A Billion Backs]]&lt;/i&gt;\n*''[[Lethal Inspection]]'' {{C|mentioned only}}\n*''[[Ghost in the Machines]]''\n[[Category:Technology]]\n[[Category:Inventions]]"

She somehow was able to lose all the weight and is currently able to control herself as an adult. However, she can lose control very easily such as in &quot;[[The Prisoner of Benda]]&quot; where she reverted back to becoming obese and put Leela's body in bad shape when they switched bodies.\n\n== Career ==\n\nAmy is a cute (though less cute as she has previously had cuteness reduction surgery)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;&quot;[[The Cyber House Rules]]&lt;/ref&gt; young Mars University student who divides her time between her studies as an engineering student and her internship at [[Planet Express]] - a post she got because she happens to be the same blood type as [[Professor Farnsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Series Has Landed]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the episode &quot;[[That Darn Katz!]]&quot;, Amy received her doctorate in Applied Physics after being an intern at Planet Express for 12 years, which Professor Hubert Farnsworth remarks she was ready 6 years ago but he forgot to tell her.\n\n== Family ==\nAmy's parents, [[Leo Wong|Leo]] and [[Inez Wong]], own [[Mars|Mars']] entire western hemisphere, the best hemisphere on Mars, according to Leo. They make their fortune raising [[buggalo]], a breed of livestock found on Mars. They have made a number of donations to [[Mars University (location)|Mars University]] to further Amy's position in the school, so much so that she is a member of the sorority Kappa Kappa Wong. They are extremely pushy in their insistence that she marry and provide them with grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mars University]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Wardrobe ==\n{{Quotebox|Dad! Why do you think I always wear these dumb boy sweatsuits?|Amy}}\n{{Quotebox|To hide your big fat butt, that's why!|Leo Wong}}\nThe owner of an extensive and impressive wardrobe, Amy is normally seen in a pink sweatsuit that exposes her midriff and belly button, in an attempt to mimic the son her father always wanted, as seen in ''[[Into The Wild Green Yonder]]''. Another reason, as shown in &quot;[[Put Your Head On My Shoulder]]&quot; is to annoy her parents, as they want her to be more ladylike.\n\n== Dating ==\nFriendly and empathetic, especially to members of the opposite gender, Amy is a party girl with a colorful dating history that even includes [[Fry]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Put Your Head on My Shoulder]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Fry has twice pretended to be Amy's boyfriend in order to save face with her parents. The first time being in &quot;[[A Flight to Remember]]&quot;, where Amy claimed Fry was her boyfriend to prevent her parents from setting her up on terrible dates. The second time was during &quot;[[Proposition Infinity]]&quot;, in an attempt to convince Amy's parents that she is no longer robo-sexual. She has also dated [[Bender]] with whom she nearly married in that same episode but he left her at the end for two robot prostitutes due to Amy wanting a monogamous relationship.\n\nShe has also shown lesbian interest as when kissing [[Leela]] in ''[[Bender's Game]]'' implying that she is a bisexual. Perhaps even pan-sexual, seeing as how she can be with humans, robots, aliens and energy-creature aliens. She is often referred to as a slut, as in ''Bender's Game'', that was her actual name. Her interstellar travels with Planet Express allow her to meet males of other species, such as a being of pure energy, [[M5438]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; until she finally married the shy, squishy green alien Lieutenant [[Kif Kroker]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Beast With a Billion Backs]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nKif was initially unwilling to take her back after he learned that while he was dead, Amy slept with [[Zapp Brannigan]] because he thought that Amy was cheating on him with his commanding officer, when in fact, she was not because marriage is valid until death. He eventually takes her back and leaves with her and the rest of the [[Planet Express crew]] into the Panama wormhole.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nKif eventually leaves Amy because she starts to flirts with bad boys, which made Kif paranoid and thought that Amy was cheating on him. In the same episode, she dates Bender and they campaign to make robosexuality (human/robot relations) legal and win the right for marriage, but Bender then dumps her after finding out Amy wants a monogamous relationship and he is seen laying around a beach with two fembots. Kif then revs up a motorcycle after becoming a &quot;bad boy&quot; himself and takes Amy back.\n\n== Languages ==\nAmy apparently speaks multiple languages including Yeti&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bender's Big Score]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and she often swears in Cantonese. She also adds extra consonants to certain words, such as &quot;smeesh&quot; (a variant of the exclamation &quot;sheesh!&quot;). Additionally, while not very fluent, she can speak a bit of Martian. \n\nFor example, &quot;Aieyah! Junk nei, o da sei nei!&quot; in Cantonese roughly translates to: &quot;Good Grief, I hate you, I will beat you to death!&quot;\n\nIn the episode &quot;[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]&quot;,  Amy angrily twists Bender's arm when he refuses to help reprogram the [[Femcomputer]], saying &quot;Fa te fung chi gu li da si ne!&quot; which means in Mandarin: &quot;You better or I'll kill you!&quot;.\n\n== Personality ==\nAmy is a klutzy girly-girl who likes to party a lot and is flexible in being wooed by men. She is kind of spoiled due to her parents being rich and she once used to look down on the poor. She has a sense of justice and patriotism but gets frustrated a lot when she is in desperate and hard situations. She constantly gets guilt-ridden when she does something wrong. She is also naive and falls for many things. Amy might also be bad at placing and losing things such as failing to hide her wallet in her pocket fully only to get it stolen by people like Bender. She is also rebellious against her parents in their many schemes such as their plot to destroy twelve percent of the Milky way to build a giant mini golf course.\n\n== Other Information ==\nShe is the owner of an obscene tattoo which is generally agreed to be both funny and cute, but sadly not visible due to primitive low-definition TV reception. She also has four other tattoos - one of a devil on her shoulder and another three on her butt, one of which is of her mom and another being a horse (presumably). She is also shown to be allergic to cats.\n\nShe is part of the Wong family, who are known for being very wealthy. However as a running gag of the show, Amy often gets robbed and pickpocketed by greedy Bender who is always after her wallet or valuable riches.\n\nAmy is shown to fall over quite a lot in some episodes, indicating that she is a little clumsy.\n\nAccording to [[Ethan &quot;Bubblegum&quot; Tate]], Amy is a Sagittarius.\n\nShe does not know what rent is.\n\n==Quotes==\n{{Quotebox|Sporty go-cart, Leela. So hip and sexy}}\n{{Quotebox|Ew, pukeatronic!}}\n{{Quotebox|Hey professor, what's this scrumpf blorking out of the machine?}}\n{{Quotebox|You trashed my board?}}\n{{Quotebox|No spluh, why do you think I'm sitting here in a stink-free zone?}}\n{{Quotebox|Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig, but later on, you find out he actually has a really good body}}\n{{Quotebox|Hey, Ancient Martian's a very hard language. ''Ah-heungi-Guh'' looks just like ''Ahgunte-Cle-deh''!}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the episode &quot;[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela]]&quot;, Amy is seen in a latex outfit with a whip. This may mean that Amy is into Fetish Play and possibly S&amp;M.\n*She is allergic to cats, as shown in &quot;[[That Darn Katz!]]&quot;\n* A running gag on the show has Amy riding on her party board only to lose control of it and crash hard on the floor with it.\n* Although sources say that Amy Wong's birthday is on May 4th, making her a Taurus, it's stated in &quot;That Darn Katz!&quot; that she's a Sagittarius.\n\n==Gallery==\n&lt;gallery&gt;\nAmy futurama.jpg\nLego amy.jpg\n6acv04-kif-and-amy 288x288.jpg\nFile:AmyBender.png\nAmy.jpg\nAmy and Bender.jpg\nAmy1.png\nAmyhead.png\nimage.jpg\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n{{Wikipedia}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n&lt;references /&gt;\n\n\n\n{{MainCharacters}}\n[[pl:]]\n[[Category:Planet Express Crew]]\n[[Category:Globetrotters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Main Characters]]\n[[Category:Photo Pop Characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Kroker Family]]"

A recurring joke is that because he interacts so little with the rest of the employees, nobody remembers ever seeing him before. It has been revealed that he owns 40,000 shares of Planet Express, more than anyone else, because he strongly believes in the company. He is lazy and can usually be found in the basement of the building, watching the boiler and reading an edition of Zero-G Juggs or [[National Pornographic]]. He almost always refers to himself in the third person. He seems to be quite profound, such as questioning whether violence really solves anything after killing a fly.\n\nOne of the few times he has been seen outside the [[Planet Express building]] is for the stock holders meeting in [[Future Stock]] and on [[Pluto]] for penguin hunting. He was also seen carting in the [[Beastie Boys]], which may mean that he works for them or at least at the [[Madison Cube Garden]], as well as at Planet Express. Scruffy also was seen saving the eco-feminist collective along with previous captives, although he wasn't held captive at all.  \n\n[[File:Scruffy.gif|thumb|250px|&quot;Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived.&quot;]]\nIn the episode [[Neutopia]], Scruffy (along with many other main and recurring characters) had his gender swapped to the opposite gender. Scruffy was the only character who did not have his (her) gender reverted back to normal at the end of the episode, as he was using the restroom at the time everyone else's genders were corrected. Despite this, Scruffy was shown to be his normal (male) self in the [[Benderama|next episode]].\n\nIn the episode [[The Prisoner of Benda]]&quot;, it is revealed that his robotic washbucket harbors romantic feelings for him which it confesses to when its personality is transferred to [[Amy Wong|Amy's]] body. Scruffy tells Washbucket that nothing can come of its love because deep down he knows that it's just 'janitorial equipment', he then tells Washbucket to leave before he asks it to stay. When Washbucket leaves he cries, implying that he returns its feelings.\n\nIn [[Law and Oracle]] it is revealed that he was brought back from the dead as a [[zombie]]. This was also confirmed in [[Simpsorama]], when Scruffy is beheaded, but is later walking around just fine.\n\nEven though Bender is the ship's cook, Scruffy seemed to be a better cook than him, regarding his corn biscuits.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Scruffy Scruffington]] is a Zombie.\n==Appearances==\n* &quot;[[Anthology of Interest I]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Parasites Lost]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[A Tale of Two Santas]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Luck of the Fryrish]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Route of All Evil]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[A Leela of Her Own]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Anthology of Interest II]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Future Stock]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The 30% Iron Chef]]\n* &quot;[[Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[A Taste of Freedom]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Jurassic Bark]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Sting]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Obsoletely Fabulous]]&quot; (animatic only)\n* &quot;[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]&quot;\n* ''[[Bender's Big Score]]''\n* ''[[The Beast With A Billion Backs]]''\n* ''[[Bender's Game]]''\n* ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''\n* &quot;[[Rebirth]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Attack of the Killer App]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Lethal Inspection]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Prisoner of Benda]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Futurama Holiday Spectacular]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Law and Oracle]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Neutopia]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Reincarnation]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Overclockwise]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Bots and the Bees]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[A Farewell to Arms]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Zapp Dingbat]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Butterjunk Effect]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[31st Century Fox]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Naturama]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Forty Percent Leadbelly]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[2-D Blacktop]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[T.: The Terrestrial]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Fry and Leela's Big Fling]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Inhuman Torch]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Saturday Morning Fun Pit]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Simpsorama]]&quot;\n[[Category:Planet Express Crew]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]"

Zoidberg]]. Zoid enjoyed a successful career as an actor, as well as later (and less succеssfully) as a director in the comedy and drama movie businesses respectively. Like his nephew, Zoid was born on the planet [[Decapod 10]]. He forged a successful career for himself as an actor, especially known for his roles in comedic silent films and action movies, wearing his signature straw hat and thick-rimmed glasses. Later, he used his fame to become a director and screenplay writer, though with limited success. But despite his failings he is still awarded some respect within the entertainment industry.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to regain his failing celebrity status, Zoid persuaded his nephew to finance a drama project, called ''[[The Magnificent Three]]'': starring [[Calculon]], Zoid, as well as featuring minor roles from Zoidberg and [[Bender]]. However, during filming the movie rapidly devolved into a fractured and nonsensical melodrama, which was greeted with ridicule. The project was Zoid's last, although he did win an award for his roles in the film, despite not being nominated.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Harold Zoid is parody of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Lloyd Harold Lloyd], a silent film actor.\n*In [[Beast with a Billion Backs]], He was the first hint viewers got that the tentacles gave one a sense of euphoria, as he is show for a brief flash smiling on [[Zoidberg|Zoidberg's]] phone after he's hit with the tentacle.\n*It could be true that he is the father of [[Zoidberg|Zoidberg's]] cousin [[Zoidfarb]].\n\n== Behind the scenes ==\nHarold Zoid was voiced by [[Hank Azaria]], who does the voice of Apu, Moe, and various other supporting characters in [[Matt Groening]]'s other FOX show, ''The Simpsons''. Azaria had at one point expressed interest in voicing a relative of Zoidberg and was contacted when the opportunity for doing so occurred. Harold Zoid's name and personality is an obvious imitation of the real life action movie pioneer Harold Lloyd. In [[The Beast with a Billion Backs]], he was voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Episodes ===\n*&quot;''[[That's Lobstertainment!]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[The Mutants Are Revolting]]&quot;''\n\n=== Movies ===\n* &quot;[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]&quot;\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Decapodians]]\n[[Category:Zoidberg Family]]"

It was written by [[David X. Cohen]], and directed by [[Peter Avanzino]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile on a ski trip, the [[Planet Express crew]] are watching the comedy stylings of [[Conan O'Brien's head]]. His act, mostly dated material from the 20th century, leaves them feeling cold. After some winter sports, the crew relaxes by the fire. [[Fry]] begins to feel nostalgic for 20th century Christmases. To cheer him up, the rest of the Planet Express staff decide to decorate for what is now called [[Xmas]], which includes cutting down an Xmas tree. Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, so they cut down a palm tree.\n\nFry decides to venture into the city to buy [[Leela]] a present, although she hadn't felt happy about Xmas when she was an orphan. The others warn him to be back before sundown, or else he will be killed by a murderous [[Santa Claus Robot|robotic Santa Claus]]. In the year [[2801]], [[Mom's Friendly Robot Company|The Friendly Robot Company]] had made up a robotic version of St. Nick himself to determine who had been naughty and who had been nice. Unfortunately, due to a programming error, the jolly robotic elf soon turned into a mad murderer when his standards were set too high and, at sundown, he will kill anyone who has been naughty. Meanwhile, Bender befriends several homeless robots and goes on a robbery spree.\n\nFry buys Leela a parrot, which escapes. Leela heads out to rescue Fry before Santa Claus arrives. After pursuing the parrot to the top of a tall building, he is saved from plunging to his death by Leela. Unfortunately, the sun goes down, the robotic Santa Claus makes his appearance and attacks the two friends.\n\nFry and Leela take refuge in the [[Planet Express Building]] after being saved by Bender and his homeless robot friends, but Santa breaks in through the chimney. Thanks to some quick thinking by [[Doctor Zoidberg]], Santa is forced back into the chimney, where an explosion sends him and his mechanical reindeer tumbling into the stratosphere. Everyone celebrates by singing &quot;[[Santa Claus Is Gunning You Down]]&quot;.\n\nRobot Santa vows that he'll be back when no one expects it, next Xmas.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*There are two [[Alienese]] signs. One says, &quot;Disposable Office Temps&quot; and the other &quot;''Joyeux Noex''&quot;. While French may have been established as a dead language in [http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/A_Clone_of_My_Own A Clone of My Own], French may be similar to Latin, in that certain phrases are still in use.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n==Hermes-isms==\nHermes uses the first of [[Hermes' catchphrase|several catchphrases he uses]]: &quot;Sweet lion of Zion!&quot;\n\n===Doppelgängers===\nLeela introduces the idea that the word ''ask'' is now pronounced as ''ax''.\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nHermes is openly hostile to Zoidberg for the first time, addressing him as &quot;Filthy crab.&quot; He had been unkind once in an earlier episode, but here it is clear that Hermes has issues with Zoidberg; these issues come to the surface with increasing frequency as the story continues. Strangely, he is also kinder toward Zoidberg in this episode than in any other, politely passing Xmas mail to Zoidberg and even going so far as to sell his own hair in order to buy a set of hair combs for Zoidberg.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry and Leela share a couple of spontaneous romantic moments when Leela goes out to bring Fry home safely. They hold hands briefly, just before Santa first attacks them, and they almost kiss under the mistletoe just when they believe they are about to die. But as in [[A Flight to Remember]], the kiss is interrupted.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Articles in need of a re-write]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

His eyes glow all the time. The toad apparently uses these as a power of hypnotism on surrounding people and animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stood&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Hypnotoad hypnotizes sheep into a pen at a pet contest and then hypnotizes the judges and the audience into awarding it first prize (see clip below). He is also known to hypnotize crew workers into committing suicide when his show is interrupted.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Hypnotoad resembles a rather large toad with eyes that put anything that looks into them into a hypnotic trance, forcing them to do whatever the Hypnotoad wants. Its eyes have black pupils with first red, then yellow rings around it. \n\n== Origins ==\nThe origins of Hypnotoad are unknown, but it is speculated that it is an alien, mutant or a product of genetic engineering. It would also appear that it is the only one of its kind on [[Earth]]. However, it is possible that a creature similar in design to the Hypnotoad found on [[Kif]]'s [[Amphibios 9|homeworld]] is part of its ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knocked&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nHypnotoad also has its own television show called ''[[Everybody Loves Hypnotoad]]''. It consists of a stationary camera filming the Hypnotoad and its noise continuously. Despite the odd premise behind the show, it ran successfully for over three seasons, possibly because it hypnotized the audience.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*The sound he makes is a recording of a turbine engine played backwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;TV.com&quot;&gt;''[http://www.tv.com/futurama/the-day-the-earth-stood-stupid/episode/21349/summary.html TV.com]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*The sound was originally a temp, but it was so wrong it had to be used. The name of the sound effect is Angry Machine.\n*Hypnotoad is one of [[Matt Groening]]'s favorite characters.&lt;ref&gt;''Commentary for &quot;[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n*There is an iPhone application called Hypnotoad in which you can change the color of the Hypnotoad, watch him as long as you like and find out how much time you have spent watching the Hypnotoad. If you shake your iPhone/iPod Touch, a voiceover says &quot;ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!&quot;.\n*There is an Android app that plays the sound and allows you to change the background behind the Hypnotoad.\n*He made a cameo appearance in the trailer for ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'' where he said &quot;Buy it, Buy it, Buy it, Buy it.&quot;\n*The Hypnotoad might have been inspired by the V-frogs from Isaac Asimov's novel ''[[wikipedia:Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus|Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus]]''. They are frog like, three legged creatures who can control the emotions of those around them, mostly serving as a defense mechanism against predators. A trance like that of the Hypnotoad is also possible when large numbers of V-frogs are working together. Due to their emotional control, they are extremely popular as pets.\n*The Hypnotoad can be seen in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' opening sequence of &quot;[[w:c:simpsons:Treehouse of Horror XXIV|Treehouse of Horror XXIV]]&quot;. It was direct by Guillermo del Toro.&lt;ref&gt;http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/10/03/the-simpsons-guillermo-del-toro-treehouse-of-horror/&lt;/ref&gt;\n*\n\n== Internet popularity  ==\n*There are many people who have not watched ''Futurama'' but are still familiar with the Hypnotoad from internet forums, where it has practically achieved meme status. It is sometimes a surprise to these people, when they start to follow the series, that Hypnotoad is a comparatively minor character.\n*The line &quot;ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!&quot; used by the judge of the animal show has became an internet sensation and is used on many Hypnotoad video clips and images.\n\n=== YouTube Videos ===\n\n{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 style=&quot;width: 600px;&quot;\n|- align=left\n! width=300px | Video\n!

He was the last in a long line of ''Yancy Frys'', going back centuries. Yancy was also the father of [[Philip J. Fry II]] and the direct ancestor of Professor [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Farnsworth]].\n\nYancy was rude to and extremely competitive with, his brother. He was extremely jealous of Fry's name. Yancy was so devastated when his brother had disappeared that he named his son [[Philip J. Fry II]] in honor of his brother, teary eyed and saying that he loved his brother and missed him everyday. However, in [[Bender's Big Score]], Fry went back in time, so Yancy spent another 12 years with the time Paradox duplicate and his son is born before the duplicate adopts the Lars persona. However, this time Paradox duplicate could have just been in an alternate timeline, or it could have been that Yancy loved his brother so much that he named his son after him anyway. Most fans don't think too much about it and just leave it up to a mistake by the creators. The impact of Luck of the Fryrish is more important. \n== Age ==\nYancy seems to be 41 in the year 2012. In the year 2000, he seems to be 29. If he was still alive, he would be 1041 years old.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Being Phillip J. Fry's brother, Yancy is an anomaly in the space-time-continum.

Well, two can play at that game, and one of them is me.|{{PAGENAME}} in &quot;[[That Darn Katz!]]&quot;}}\n\n'''Lord Nibbler''' (born 274 BC), known mostly just as '''Nibbler''', though discovered on the planet [[Vergon 6]] by [[Bender]], [[Fry]] and [[Leela]],\n[[Bender]] shortly before its destruction, is in fact a [[Nibblonian]]. He has existed since shortly before the dawn of time.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:NibblerSpacePilot3000.png|thumb|left|Nibbler's shadow]]\nOn December 31, 1999, Nibbler was responsible for pushing [[Fry]] into the [[Cryogenic tube]], which brought him a millennium into the future so that he would be present to stop the [[Brain Spawn]] when they attacked [[Earth]]. He also made the prank call for I.C. Weiner.\n\nFor the next thousand years, Nibbler was stationed on the [[planet]] Vergon 6 as Supreme Fuzzler, which was an ancient depository of Nibblonian fecal matter, also known as [[dark matter]]. Leela was unaware of his true nature.\n\nWhen the Brain Spawn surfaced to attack Earth, Nibbler helped beat their asses, but was careful to wipe the memory of the [[Planet Express crew]], although he forgot to do the same after the events of ''[[Bender's Big Score]]''.\n\nNibbler spoke out passionately, but futilely, against the use of the [[Time Code]] when it was discovered on Fry's butt by the [[Nudist Alien Scammers]]. In the end he advises everyone to get out of the universe as that same universe splits open and the [[Anomaly]] appears in the sky.[[File:Nibbler2.png|thumb]]\n\nWhen [[Walt]], [[Larry]], and [[Igner]] infiltrate [[Planet Express]] to find the [[Anti-Backwards Crystal]], they kidnapped Nibbler and imprisoned him with the rest of the Nibblonian population in Mom's Dark Matter mine. His hellish imprisonment of being force-fed chickens and prune juice and having his excrement harvested for fuel was ended when dark matter was made unusable as a fuel, only to be utilized by the Professor's brilliant replacement for the starship fuel: Nibbler Power.\n\nHe also appears in the episode &quot;[[That Darn Katz!]]&quot; when he breaks up with [[Leela]] as her pet and becomes part of [[Planet Express Crew|The Crew]]. Later on when [[Amy]] presents her thesis at [[Mars University]], a cat sneaks aboard the ship and hypnotizes the crew. Later on the cat summons a saucer which other cats arrive on. Amy is allergic to cats and Nibbler is jealous, so they are the only ones not hypnotized. The crew and the cats have something going on in the basement where only ones with a cat can help and see. Amy and Nibbler sneak in and find out they are trying to stop [[Earth]]'s rotation and return it to the cat's homeworld, [[Thuban 9]]. Once they stop it by getting a static charge from 50,000 cats rubbing against the surface, they return home and celebrate. Amy later uses her thesis to start the Earth again in the other direction. This takes away the rotation of [[Thuban 9]] and Nibbler becomes Leela's pet again.\n\n== Physical Appearance ==\nNibbler is a biped, about a foot tall, with black fur, long arms, stubby legs, as well as a proportionally large head. He has two large eyes embedded in his skull and a small third eye on the end of a stalk that protrudes from the top of his head and only one nostril on his nose.. He has large fangs and a surprisingly wide mouth, making him capable of eating any creature regardless of its size. He excretes small but super-dense round pellets of dark matter, though he is light enough for humans to easily pick up. These traits are assumed to be standard for all Nibblonians.\n\nNibbler produce high-pitched grunting and gurgling noises, apparently in a meaningless babble. This is in fact his native language. However, for the benefit of non-Nibblonians to whom he wishes to communicate, as well as the viewing audience, he can speak in coherent English, which he delivers in a deep, oratorical voice, befitting his personality and status as a lord. He is usually seen wearing a diaper and a red cape given to him by his owner, [[Turanga Leela]].\n\n== Persona Around Other Species ==\n[[File:Nibbler and leela.jpg|thumb|left|Leela and Nibbler meet on [[Vergon 6]]]]\nUpon adopting him, the lonely Leela quickly and incorrectly, surmised that Nibbler was a defenseless, cute and stupid animal with an enormous appetite. Leela reinforced this opinion by dressing Nibbler in a baby's diaper and adorning him with a red cape.\n\nAs a result some employees of [[Planet Express]] showered Nibbler with attention and affection, as if he were a baby. This occurs much to the anger of the attention-seeking [[Bender]], who subsequently despises Nibbler and constantly seeks ways of having him murdered or lost.  Nibbler once bit Bender's shiny metal ass.\n\n== True Species ==\nIt is later revealed that Nibbler and his species the Nibblonians, are an ancient race of advanced beings who protect the universe from harm using an array of amazing and mysterious powers. This includes protecting [[Fry]], who has a great destiny that must be fulfilled: Nibbler engineered his cryogenic suspension so he would be alive at the right time. Though this may seem to be a retcon, Nibbler's shadow is visible as Fry falls off his chair in the [[Space Pilot 3000|first episode]] and also in other versions of the same scene such as his third eye poking out of the trash and both his and Fry's shadow appearing when Fry falls off his chair in &quot;[[The Why of Fry]]&quot;.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Lord Nibbler's true name remains mysterious because according to Nibbler: &quot;That is for your sake. In the time it would take to utter one letter of my true name a trillion cosmosies would flare into existence and sink into Eternal Night!&quot;\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Episodes ===\n* &quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot; (cameo during the Cryogenic Freezing Sequence)\n* &quot;[[Love's Labour Lost in Space]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Hell is Other Robots]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[I Second That Emotion]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[A Head in the Polls]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[A Tale of Two Santas]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Anthology of Interest II|Anthology of Interest ll]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Jurassic Bark]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Why of Fry]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Obsoletely Fabulous]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Rebirth]]&quot;\n* [[That Darn Katz!|That Darn Katz]]!\n* &quot;[[Benderama]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Game of Tones]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Meanwhile]]&quot;\n\n=== Movies ===\n* &quot;[[Bender's Big Score]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Bender's Game]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]&quot;\n\n=== Comics ===\n* ...&quot;[[...But Deliver Us To Evil!|But Deliver Us To Evil]]!&quot;\n\n* &quot;[[As The Wormhole Turns]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Follow the Reader]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[A Bump in the Flight]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[How Much is that Mutant in the Window?|How Much is that Mutant in the Window]]?&quot;\n* &quot;[[Steampunk'd]]&quot;\n=== Games ===\n* &quot;[[Futurama: The Game]]&quot; (collectable)\n== Behind the Scenes ==\nDespite the wide disparity in pitch and timbre, both Nibbler's monkey-like jabber and his regular speaking voice are provided by legendary voice actor [[Frank Welker]].\n\n==Gallery==\n&lt;gallery&gt;\nFile:NibblerPlush.png\nnibbler bickini.jpg\n210 nibbler-satisfied.gif|Nibbler with no pants.\nnibbler4.jpg\n167 nibbler-eats-elzar.gif\n204 nibbler-eating-turkey.gif\n4621842098 5c414ab3de.jpg|Lego Lord Nibbler\n012_lord-nibbler.gif|Lord Nibbler In His Space Suit\na9e37a399a9286721ed4d2cdc828b63c.jpg\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n[[Category:Planet Express Crew]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Main Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Photo Pop Characters]]"

[holds up a stone tablet which reads &quot;God needs booze&quot;].|Malachi, Sr.}}\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring a noisy attack led by a [[Space Pirate]], [[Bender]], trying to find some peace and quiet in the torpedo tube, is launched into interstellar space beyond the reach of [[Fry]] and [[Leela]]. As they were going top speed when they fired Bender, Bender was therefore going faster than the [[Planet Express ship]]'s top speed and thus is impossible to recover. After an asteroid crashes into him, a civilization of tiny humanoids, the [[Shrimpkin]]s, grows on Bender and they begin worshiping him as a deity. At first, Bender enjoys his new-found status and has his followers brew what for them are vast quantities of &quot;Lordweiser&quot; beer. The tiny denizens living on him begin praying for rain, sun and wealth: Bender attempts to heed their prayers, failing comically and harming the Shrimpkins in the process. Eventually, the Shrimpkins who migrated to his backside feel their prayers are unheeded and become atheists. The micro-civilization is ultimately and simultaneously destroyed when the front- and back-side factions build and use atomic weapons out of Bender's nuclear pile. \n\n[[File:Godentity.jpg|thumb|right|The God Entity]]\nBender soon floats toward a cosmic entity who can signal in binary. It behaves somewhat like a sophisticated cosmic computer resembling a galaxy with colored stars, who is &quot;user friendly...my good chum&quot;. The [[God Entity]] is nearly omniscient: when Bender mentions his experiences with the Shrimpkins, the God Entity responds, in an encouraging tone, &quot;Yes, I saw... you were doing well until everyone died&quot;. The God Entity advises that the use of deitylike powers requires a &quot;light touch&quot; so that those one intends to aid will neither lose hope nor become dependent on supernatural intervention.\n\nDuring Bender's encounter with the God Entity, Fry and Leela search for a way to contact Bender. His odor couldn't be detected by the [[Smell-O-Scope]] and everyone tries to tell Fry to get over Bender, even bringing in [[Helper]]. Fry refuses to give up, thinking that he could try something desperate and crazy. After getting no help with Father Changstein Al Gamal at the First Amalgamated Church, he learns from the [[Robot Gypsy]] of the [[Monks of T'shuva]], a sect of secretive monks who use a combination radio telescope/amplifying transmitter to search for God in space and with which the monks hope to contact God so that they may &quot;utter unto him a short prayer&quot;. With Leela reluctantly tagging along, Fry makes his way through the Himalayas and finds the monastery. However, the monks refuse to delay their search for God to allow Fry to search for Bender. When Fry demands that he use the telescope, the monks react and put up martial arts stances. Leela stands up in Fry's defense, only for the monks to admit that their practise of martial arts is purely for meditation and they are pacifists. Leela then directs them into the laundry room. Fry spends the next three days searching for Bender, while the imprisoned monks eat their own shoes for sustenance. Fry gives up the search for Bender and hits the telescope controls, which happen to aim the telescope at the God Entity, who hears Fry say, &quot;I wish I had Bender back&quot;. The entity then throws Bender all the way back to Earth, with a parachute and a peremptory farewell, just as Fry and Leela are leaving the monastery. After a sizzling embrace, Bender is convinced from his encounter that &quot;God&quot; does little to help people and insists on travelling back to the monastery to free the trapped monks. The God entity chuckles and repeats the advice he gave to Bender: &quot;When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.&quot;\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\n* Fry and Leela destroy two space-pirate space-ships.\n* Bender is fired from a torpedo tube and his body smashes through two walls of a space-pirate space-ship.\n* A pea-sized asteroid whizzes through Bender's head, leaving a temporary, pea-sized hole.\n* Although different individuals suffer in different ways (Malachai loses an arm, many Shrimpkins are mangled and others die of pestilence while manufacturing booze for Bender, etc.), the entire Shrimpkin population is ultimately obliterated by nuclear war.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* To help Fry with his loss, Amy and Hermes bring him a new friend, a robot called &quot;Helper&quot;.\n* The Robot Gypsy channels Fry's friend &quot;Bonder&quot;\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Three]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award, but lost to ''[[The Simpsons]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Bender]] and [[Fry]] are practicing magic tricks, when Fry spots a newspaper that claims people found 20th century artifacts. The two then visit the The Museum of Natural History exhibit, where Fry finds out that it is actually [[Panucci's Pizza]], the old pizza parlor where Fry used to work. Within the exhibit, Fry finds his old dog, [[Seymour Asses|Seymour]], fossilized and on display in the exhibit. After a lengthy protest, the museum gives Fry the fossilized dog. Fry starts to treat Seymour like an actual dog, and Bender grows jealous of Fry's nonstop devotion to Seymour. At [[Planet Express]], [[Hubert Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] reveals that he can clone a version of Seymour that Fry knew and loved. Just before Seymour's cloning process is completed, in a jealous rage, Bender throws Seymour's fossilized body into the lava pit in the basement. Farnsworth reveals that because Seymour was made of dolomite, he might survive the hot lava. Bender, feeling remorseful, and being 40% dolomite, decides to go after the dolomite dog. After a long while, Bender resurfaces with Seymour intact. While cloning Seymour the second time, Farnsworth reveals that Seymour was 15 years old when he died, leading Fry to think that Seymour must have lived a full life after he was frozen. Fry destroys the machine and leaves Seymour fossilized.\n\nThroughout the episode, flashbacks are shown revealing how Fry and Seymour met, how they acted together and how Seymour lived after Fry was frozen. The final scene shows a slow and heartwrenching montage of passing years outside Panucci's where Seymour waits continuously for Fry to return (a reference to Hachiko, a dog who had a similar experience). Finally, Seymour lies down, closes his eyes, and goes to sleep for the last time.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Injury, dismemberment===\n* Bender removes his head to show his imaginary magician's audience that he isn't hiding anything there.\n* In a museum display, an animatronic pizza chef spanks an animatronic delivery boy with a wooden peel.\n* Fry uses Bender's foot to break the glass case that contains Seymour's fossilized remains.\n* Museum security guards throw Fry bodily down the stairs at the entrance to the museum.\n* Bender beats Zoidberg with a magic wand.\n* Farnsworth finds a piece of toe in the cloning tank, presumably left over from [[A Clone of My Own|when Cubert was cloned]].\n* Bender reveals that his torso contains the remains of [[Wikipedia:Charlemagne|Charlemagne]].\n* The head of Fry's hammer breaks off and causes an unspecified injury to Bender off-screen.\n* Amy and Leela injure each other with varying degrees of gruesomeness as they wrestle half-naked.\n* Bender kicks Robo-puppy across the room into a wall, setting off Robo-puppy's mistreatment alert.\n* Fry injures himself attempting to beat bender.\n* Amy and Leela tackle Fry to prevent him jumping into the volcanic pool.\n* Bender loses some rivets while swimming in the magma. When he returns to the surface, his eyes melt away to nothing.\n\n===Time-Travel===\nIn a flashback to the night Fry was frozen, there is a short closeup on a waste bin in the cryogenics lab. Nibbler's topmost eye is visible among the discarded paperwork. This detail is explained in a later episode, [[The Why of Fry]].\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry has absolutely no response at all to the half-naked wrestling match between Leela and Amy. Leela is equally unmoved by the sight of Fry in his underwear.\n\n===Appointments===\nIt is revealed here that there is a volcanic vent forming a magma pool in the Planet Express basement.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

Slurm delivery trucks can be frequently spotted, including in the Futurama opening credits (shortly before the [[Planet Express ship]] crashes into the billboard). The drink's slogan is 'It's Highly Addictive!' and its distribution is handled by Bureau of Soft Drinks, Tobacco, and Firearms, a parody of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (which is now known as Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives).\n\nSlurm has an active marketing campaign similar to the leading soft drinks of today. The campaign was fronted by [[Slurms McKenzie]] until his tragic death. The campaign uses an instrumental version of 'I've Got a Tan' by The Four Postmen. The Slurm posters seen throughout the episodes acted as one of the first clues to deciphering the Alien Language and have been compared to the Rosetta Stone by fans. Slurm also acts as a sponsor for two ladies competing in the Butterfly Derby.\n\nSlurm is made on the planet [[Wormulon]].\n\nIn [[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory]], Fry, [[Leela]], and [[Bender]] find out that it's made from a secretion from the anus of the [[Wormulon Queen]].

The crew persuades him to undergo a compatibility upgrade.\n\nBender is anxious as he waits in line, and eventually breaks out of the upgrade center. Unsure of where to go, Bender paddles out into the (assumed) Atlantic Ocean. Eventually washing up on an island, Bender discovers that it is populated with a variety of obsolete robots. Bender finds joy in the simplified, anti-technology lifestyle. He goes through a downgrade process, which results in his body being converted almost exclusively to a wood chassis.\n\nBender then decides to lead a raid against mankind, taking his fellow obsolete robots back to the mainland on a mission to crush technology wherever they find it. When they reach the [[Planet Express building]], Bender attempts to have their catapult destroy Robot 1-X. The attempt knocks a support from the [[Planet Express ship]], which catches the crew partly underneath a wing. Fuel leaks out and catches fire, circling the crew in flames. Bender attempts to save them, but his wooden body turns out to have developed a termite infestation. Then, while attempting to stretch his arms, they fall out of their sockets. Inching himself toward his friends, his new wood body catches on fire. Bender then instructs Robot 1-X to save his friends (and [[Zoidberg]]). Robot 1-X does so, which leaves Bender praising the usefulness of the robot. At this point, it becomes clear that Bender has just experienced the compatibility upgrade, and his entire escape/time at the island/raid on technology has all been part of his imagination. Bender leaves the upgrade center with the thought that &quot;reality is what you make of it.&quot;\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Injury===\n* Farnsworth and Wernstrom have a fistfight at the [[Roboticon 3003|Roboticon]] trade show.\n* A stage prop crashes into Bender's head, knocking him to the floor and causing the contents of his torso to spill out.\n* Bender roughly makes out with Nibbler against Nibbler's will.\n* Bender flings himself out the window of a multi-story building and crashes face-first into the ground.\n* An angry duck bites Bender on the finger.\n* A coconut falls from a tree and lands on Benders face.\n* Robot 1-X clobbers himself on the head a few times with a sledgehammer.\n* Bender slaps Robot 1-X in the faceplate.\n* The entire crew except for Bender and Robot 1-X are trapped under the wing of the ship and are in danger of burning to death.\n* Wooden Bender's leg breaks from termite damage.\n* Wooden Bender's arms fall off when he tries to extend them.\n* Wooden Bender burns to ash except for his eye and mouth assemblies.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* Bender rebuilds himself from wooden components.\n* The entire story of Bender's downgrading adventure turns out to have been a dream induced in Bender by the upgrade process.\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

She is also one of the main antagonists of the ''[[Futurama]]'' series.\n\n== Personality ==\nAs one of the richest people on [[Earth]], she maintains her public image as a sweet, matronly figure through the use of things such as a fat-suit, a heart-shaped hairdo and putting on a façade which casts her as the friendly mother of all robots but she is in fact emaciated, arrogant, foul-mouthed, greedy, evil, and malevolent.\n\nMom is not above using criminal or borderlinе criminal methods to accumulate greater profits. She has been known or suspected of using brutal business practices and covert action to eliminate threats from other companies or to keep potential products from the market. She is also obsessed with taking down [[Planet Express]] and therefore create a monopoly out of it.\n\nAll robots produced by MomCorp have been equipped with a device that allows Mom to force them to do her bidding, although she appears to have used this only once on [[Mother's Day]] in 3003. She receives yearly Mother's Day gifts and cards from the robots, which she turns into hocus-pocus cures for cancer and orphanage-grade toilet paper respectively.\n\n== Family ==\nMom was briefly married to [[Ogden Wernstrom]], with whom it is possible she had two children, [[Walt]] and [[Larry]]. She then became romantically involved with [[Hubert J. Farnsworth]] while he was an employee at MomCorp and had an illicit affair with him. They separated after she turned his invention [[Q.T. McWhiskers]] into a weapon of war, but not before she became pregnant with her third son [[Igner]] (although neither Farnsworth nor Igner were aware of this until the events of ''[[Bender's Game]]'').\n\nAt several points Mom has temporarily gotten back together with Professors Farnsworth and Wernstrom.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Episodes ===\n* &quot;[[A Fishful of Dollars]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Mother's Day]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Future Stock]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Crimes of the Hot]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Obsoletely Fabulous]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Attack of the Killer App]]&quot;&quot;\n* &quot;[[Lethal Inspection]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Tip of the Zoidberg]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Overclockwise]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[A Farewell to Arms]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Leela and the Genestalk]]&quot;\n\n=== Specials ===\n* &quot;[[Anthology of Interest II|Anthology of Interest ll]]&quot;\n\n* &quot;[[Naturama]]&quot;\n\n=== Films ===\n* &quot;[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Bender's Game]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Into The Wild Green Yonder]]&quot;\n\n=== Games ===\n* &quot;[[Futurama: The Game]]&quot;\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]\n[[Category:Main Characters]]\n[[Category:Photo Pop Characters]]\n[[Category:Planet Express Crew]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"

    "text": "[[File:Darkmatter.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Dark matter created by [[Nibbler]]]]\nThe '''dark matter''' is a substance of which little is known. In scientific terms, dark matter refers to matter undetectable through electromagnetic interactions, meaning that it can't reflect light and thus is invisible. In ''[[Futurama]]'', it is used as a starship fuel in which [[Nibblonians]] excrete. It is the densest, and therefore heaviest, substance in the universe, with each ball that Nibbler produces weighing as much as 1000 suns. According to Professor [[Farnsworth]], dark matter is so dense that &quot;each pound of it weighs over ten thousand pounds.&quot;\n\nDuring the third time he worked for [[Mom]], Professor [[Farnsworth]] used a particle accelerator to smash some dark matter in an ill conceived attempt to create a more durable harpsichord wax. In the process, he created a non-local metaparticle crystal that empowered dark matter as a fuel and an [[Anti-Backwards Crystal]], that if in six inches proximity to the fuel crystal, could render all dark matter useless. [[Mom]] took the first crystal to hold a dark matter enterprise over the universe. She even mined out the dark matter resources of [[Vergon 6]], which was filled up with the Nibblonians stationed there. Upon realizing the &quot;cute runts&quot; could produce the fuel, she captured a ship full of them, except [[Nibbler]]. Her company force feeds the Nibblonians so they will mass produce dark matter.\n\nMom instigated a dark matter shortage to gain higher prices. However, as a result of Professor [[Farnsworth]] attempting to use the [[Anti-Backwards Crystal]], all dark matter is rendered useless. Professor [[Farnsworth]] comes up with a temporary fuel &quot;Nibbler power&quot;.\n\nBy the year [[3009]], dark matter has been replaced by [[whale oil]], as proven by the events of [[Into the Wild Green Yonder]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Dark matter engine]]\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]''\n*''[[Brannigan, Begin Again]]''\n*''[[Obsoletely Fabulous]]''\n*''[[The Why of Fry]]''\n*''[[Bender's Game]]''\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Elements]]"

Unfortunatley, this causes the Earthicans to think of his speech as desecration and betrays him. This sets off a [[Don't Mess with Earth|movement]] to prosecute him as he flees to a Decapodian embassy. [[Ambassador Moiven]] promises the full support of the government. However, they are unable to give him marshmallows in his cocoa, a fact which seriously enrages Zoidberg.\n[[File:Decapodians.jpg|thumb|right|Zoidberg meets with his fellow Decapodians.]]\nZoidberg acquires the services of [[Old Man Waterfall]] to act as his lawyer. The trial goes in session and it is clear that it will be an unfair one.  As a result of this unfairness and injustice, The Supreme Court rules against Zoidberg, in a vote of 6 to 3. Also, in a &quot;double whammy&quot; vote, the Court finds polygamy constitutional. He is instructed to apologize. Zoidberg, feeling disgusted and betrayed, refuses, and is then sentenced to death. Zapp Brannigan and a brigade of troops proceed to attack the Decapodian embassy. The Decapodians takes this as a declaration of war. Moiven calls on Decapodian invasion forces to attack Earth. Zapp tries to fight back with all planetary defenses but he gives the codes to a poorly disguised Decapodian double agent, under alias Hugh Man, who Kif can see through. The Decapodians clamp the [[Nimbus]], the last line of defense. The &quot;Handsome Invaders&quot; enslave Earth, claiming it doesn't know freedom, forcing humans to &quot;glob&quot; mud, building a [[Mobile Oppression Palace|mobile oppression palace]], to cut occupation costs as the other warships depart. The crew decide to free themselves, and attempt to blow it up. They go to an old war museum and steal a heat-seeking missile. Unfortunately, palace is &quot;cold blooded&quot; though, so their missile won't target it. Zoidberg has a change of heart after the MOP crushes Old Man Waterfall, and sets a nearby flag on fire much to the Earthicans dismay, spears the MOP with it, thus leading the heat-seeking missile to free Earth again. Zoidberg is hailed as a hero and is given his right to appeal.  He wins his appeal and  is allowed a bite of the new Earth flag and raises it up on the flagpole.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*The sign in [[Alienese]] reads, &quot;A Venusian Cooperation&quot;.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Injury, Dismemberment, Death===\n* A brief war occurs, followed by a period of worldwide enslavement by the Decapodians.\n* Kif overextends his right arm while attempting to carry a small but very heavy briefcase.\n* Bender shoots himself in the face with a crossbow.\n* The Decapodian MOP crushes Old Man Waterfall to death.\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nHermes calls Zoidberg &quot;turkey of the sea,&quot; but this outburst could be driven as much by understandable frustration as by the deep-seated issues that flare up occasionally.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taste Of Freedom, A}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

During &quot;[[A Head in the Polls]]&quot;, Bender, Fry, and Leela blackmail Nixon by use of audiotape. This is a reference to the famous Nixon tapes. He also says &quot;You're all going to jail, and don't expect me to grant a pardon like that sissy Ford&quot;. This is a clear reference to the 38th President of the United States, [[Wikipedia:Gerald Ford|Gerald Ford]], who pardoned Nixon following Watergate.\n\nAlso, in &quot;A Head in the Polls&quot;, Nixon stays at the Watergate, a reference to the scandal which caused Nixon to resign. He is very tyrannical and often abused his power while in office but the people did not care about.\n\nIn the episode &quot;[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela]]&quot;, the censorship death sphere, V-Giny, erases a planet and Nixon comments on it saying &quot;It erased that planet like 18 minutes of incriminating tape.&quot; This references the 18 and a half minutes of the Nixon tapes that were missing under controversial circumstances.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'', he claims he staged the Moon Landing on Venus.  \n\n==Notes==\n*His head is on the $1000 bill and $300 bill as well as the Tricky Dick Fun Bill.\n*He is the &quot;original [[Wikipedia:Gerber baby|Gerber baby]]&quot; according to [[Zapp Brannigan]].\n*He claims to have staged the Moon Landing, on Venus.\n*Nixon appears with the [[Headless Body of Spiro Agnew]], his Vice President during the 70's.\n*He still has [[Checkers' head]] in a jar during his election campaign.\n*He is a fan of [[Ultimate Robot Fighting]].\n*Due to their similar personalities, he is a friend of [[Morbo]].\n*In the episode &quot;[[Time Keeps on Slippin']]&quot;, he gives [[Hubert J.

It is used by [[Bender]], [[Fry]] and [[Leela]] to take various packages all over the galaxy. It has windshield wipers, a coffee maker, cup holders, a microwave, games room, cargo hold and a laundry room.\n\nIt was shown in [[The Sting]] that there was a previous ship: seemingly identical to the current one but painted a dull gray color. It was piloted by Fаrnsworth's previous crew, whom he had sent off on a suicide mission to collect space honey.\n\nThe ship was designed and built by Professor [[Farnsworth]] and runs on [[dark matter]], mostly supplied by [[Nibbler]]. After the dark matter incident in [[Bender's Game]] where dark matter was rendered worthless, it used [[whale oil]]. The ship does not actually move itself, but, using the [[Dark Matter Accelerator]], it moves the universe around it as stated by Professor Farnsworth and later realized by [[Cubert Farnsworth]]. It's fairly well fortified, with a laser cannon and two torpedo tubes. It's shielding has held up against a torrent of missiles, yet the ship falls victim to such things as rocks while parked.\n\nOnce, the ship has also shown that it has an independent personality. Originally, the ship had a male personality, but after recurring disputes with Bender, Prof. Fаrnsworth changed its programming to female, leading to a romance between her and Bender. Since she is able to drive herself, it remains unknown why there needs to be a pilot. This has been the only episode that has shown the ship having a personality. She was disabled towards the end of the episode, however a part of her personality was merged with Bender.

She is the tomboyishly beautiful and very sexy captain of the Planet Express ship. With a &quot;no rain or sleet&quot; attitude and a &quot;kick-your-ass&quot; grace, this delivery captain is a refreshing source of professionalism to counterpoint the rest of the crew. For better or worse, the ship runs on her high octane passions, be it because of her longing for family, her love of violence, her commitment to a job well done, or her affection for animals. She has been known to scrap the missions on a whim on the promise of learning more of her past, jeopardize the crew's lives to spite Zapp Brannigan and save Nibbler.  Leela was the first female Blernsball player and the worst player ever because of her poor depth perception (this is due to the fact that she has one eye). However, in space, depth perception is less useful because things are further away and so Leela is captain of the Planet Express ship.\n\nHer usual costume is gray boots, black leggings and a white tank top.\n\n==Childhood==\nHaving grown up in the [[Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium]], Leela long lived the lonely life of an orphan, thinking herself as the only member of an unknown alien race. It is not until her late 20s that she discovers she is in fact the daughter of [[Turanga Morris]] and [[Turanga Munda]], shamed sewer mutants from Earth's own degraded depths.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Leela's Homeworld]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that she was born as a surprisingly unmutated mutant, her only known mutations being purple hair, the elbow talons she usually shaves, an concessional appearance of a singing boil she named Susan and her distinct cyclops eye. Leela was taught Kung-Fu by [[Master Fnog]], who had crashed down on her dreams by telling her that she did not have &quot;the will of the warrior&quot; but the will of &quot;a schoolmarm&quot; or &quot;housewife.&quot;\n\n==Adulthood==\n{{Quote|Look, I don't know about your previous captains, but I intend to do as little dying as possible.|The Series Has Landed - Turanga Leela on dying}}\nAfter growing up, Leela begins work at [[Applied Cryogenics]] as a Fate Assignment Officer, code number &quot;1BDI&quot; (one beady eye). When Leela meets [[Fry]], she becomes a job deserter in favor of piloting for [[Planet Express]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Leela lives alone in a small unfurnished apartment, &quot;1I&quot; (one eye) in [[New New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Parasites Lost]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She was named ''Orphan of the Year'' in [[3000]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Leela's Homeworld]]&lt;/ref&gt; and for a short while, Miss Universe.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Lesser of Two Evils]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Due to an accident, she and [[Kif Kroker]] have several children together, though [[Amy]], as Kif's &quot;Fon-Fon-Ru&quot;, is considered the mother.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Personality==\nIn addition to her tomboyish nature, beauty and sexiness, Leela is known for her extreme sensitivity and no-nonsense personality. She is a headstrong woman who focuses on work first and fun later. She is known for loving animals that are endangered, which led her to meeting [[Nibbler]] for the first time. She routinely rejects perverts such as Zapp Brannigan. She frequently learns from her mistakes and tries to right many wrongs. She is also shown to be a hardcore pacifist as she was the only citizen on Earth who would definitely never vote for Nixon's Head to be president. She is fairly impulsive and rejected Fry in the original series, as she did not share his feelings.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Relationships with Misc. Characters===\n{{Quote|Men who call too much are the worst... I bet.|Amazon Women in the Mood}}\nLeela has an ex-boyfriend named Sean: uneducated, unambitious, pasty and hunched, with an incredible, beautiful creative soul and musical talent. Their breakup may not have been entirely mutual, judging by the fact that Leela stresses how mutual it was every chance she can and that she believed he was cheating on her.\n\nShe went on at least one date with Doug.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLeela dated the [[Dean Vernon|Dean of Mars University]] after [[Fratbots]] won a boating race, however, he didn't call her after one date.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Mars University]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Adlai.jpg|thumb|217px|Adlai]]\nLeela started dating [[Adlai Atkins]], an orphan she grew up with after she reconnected with him as an adult. They became engaged after he performed phases eye surgery on her, but broke up after Leela realized he didn't like her the way she was.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Cyber House Rules]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLeela dated [[Chaz]], the mayor's aide, but broke up with him after she realized he thought he was too important for most everyone.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Why of Fry]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhile stranded on [[Omega 3]], Leela has a quick fling with [[William Shatner]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLeela almost married [[Alkazar]] after he tricked her into thinking they were the last of their race.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Bicyclops Built For Two]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLeela gets engaged to [[Yivo]], along with the rest of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLeela made out with [[Amy Wong]] during the battle at [[Wipe Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bender's Game]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Relationship with Zapp Brannigan===\nLeela met [[Zapp Brannigan]] en route to [[Vergon 6]]. She took pity on him and had sex with him, something she regrets constantly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Zapp believes he still has a chance with Leela and hits on her every time they meet. Bender frequently reminds Leela about her one night stand with Zapp, to her disgust. Zapp makes an attempt to convince Leela that they will be the new Adam and Eve in the episode, In-A-Gada-Da-Leela. Leela even got very upset when Zapp started dating her mom and got very close to marrying her.\n\n===Relationship with Bender===\nLeela first met Bender when she was chasing after Fry, before later working together at Planet Express. Although they are seen as friends, they rarely seem to agree with one another, or even enjoy each others company, due to Leela's un-impulsive nature and Bender being the subsequent opposite. [[I Second That Emotion|After Bender flushed Nibbler down the toilet]], the Professor installed an empathy chip in Bender, allowing him to feel Leela's emotions. The act initially seemed to bond the two, but it was later revealed that the empathy chip had to be running at triple capacity to get Bender even close to Leela's true feelings. When Bender asked Leela what she likes most about him, she commented that she liked his &quot;in-your-face attitude.&quot;\n\n===Relationships with other members of Planet Express===\nLeela's relationships with the rest of the Planet Express crew differs from time to time. Though she mostly spends time with Fry and Bender, she sometimes hangs around [http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/John_A._Zoidberg Zoidberg], Hermes, as well as the Professor. However, apart from Bender and Fry, she hangs out most with Amy Wong. She first met Amy after joining Planet Express and didn't think much of her. She was shocked when Amy saved her and Fry's life by flying to their rescue in the Planet Express ship. Leela and Amy's friendship is hot and cold at times, and Leela often feels jealous of her.\n\n===Relationship with Fry===\n\n{{Main|Fry's and Leela's relationship}}\n\nInitially at odds with [[Fry]], Leela comes to appreciate him and marries him twice, the second accompanied by &quot;a very long honeymoon&quot; that lasts for decades.\n\n==Death &amp; Comeback==\nLeela survives the Planet Express Ship crashing because of Fry shielding her with his body. After accidentally building [[Fry-bot]] with too much wiring she was severely electrocuted to death but was brought back by the stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Rebirth]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Trivia==\n*Leela's officer code (1BDI) is reference to her only having one eye.\n*at the last quarter of S2E2, she said: I don't want to die at the age of 25.\n*In a commentary track for Futurama, creator [[Matt Groening]] states that Leela's name is derived from the [[w:c:tardis:Fourth Doctor|Fourth Doctor]]'s companion [[w:c:tardis:Leela|Leela]] on the British science fiction television show ''[[w:c:tardis:Doctor Who|Doctor Who]]''.\n** Her last name might also have been inspired by the German, Hungarian, Swedish and Spanish word ''lila'' (&quot;purple, violet&quot;) , in a possible allusion to her hair color. It is also possible that Leela's name is a parody of Princess Leia Organa from ''Star Wars'' as she was once dressed up like her in the comic-con costume contest.\n** Her name also plays on ''Turangalîla'', the Sanskrit title of the landmark ''Turangalîla-Symphonie'' by French composer Olivier Messiaen.\n*The wrist device that Leela is seen consistently wearing has been shown to have at least seven uses: a communicator,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; reattach Fry's nose (a small laser),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Spanish Fry]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; play tetris &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Luck of the Fryish]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and Pong, detect whether or not the Omicronian young (later known as Popplers) are edible,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Problem With Popplers]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; a tracking device receiver she uses in the Central Bureaucracy,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; a tissue dispenser, targeted advertising, as well as has a (possibly deadly) laser.\n*In &quot;[[Rebirth]]&quot;, it is revealed that Leela wears size 12 shoes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n* According to Zapp Brannigan in ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'', Leela's measurements are 36-24-36. So Leela's body measurements match perfectly to having a hourglass figure due to a 36 inch bust and hip size, as well as a 24 inch waist.\n*Leela also has a singing boil on her buttocks named Susan, a parody of Susan Boyle, which she lances all the time.\n*In &quot;[[The Butterjunk Effect]]&quot;, it is said that Leela and Amy auditioned to be Rockettes, however they kicked two Rockettes to death and did not get the job.\n*In &quot;[[Fun on a Bun]]&quot;, we learn that Leela is flexible as she is able to brush her hair with her foot. Fry also has this ability, as shown in the same episode, which she remarks as &quot;double dipping.&quot;\n*It is implied that Leela has multiple personality disorder as she became arrogant after being corrupted by Hollywood and became obsessed with killing a space whale after it ate a monument she was delivering.\n*The name of Leela's hair color is actually called leela (a dark shade of purple). \n*In &quot;[[The Problem With Popplers]]&quot; it's revealed that &quot;Turanga&quot; is Leela's surname.\n*In her debut, it is shown that Leela can be easily annoyed by people who are put off by her one eye.\n*Leela has 205 bones (a normal human has 206) in her body. (&quot;[[Fry Am The Egg Man]]&quot;.).\n* Her birthday is December 3rd because in the episode (&quot;[[The Late Philip J. Fry]]&quot;), they move up in years, not days and the date says 12/03.\n* Leela temporarily became a man in the episode Neutopia.\n* When Leela tries to kill something, she says &quot;it will be just like stomping a puppy.&quot;\n* Leela has the last spoken line of the series: &quot;I do&quot;.\n\n==Gallery==\n&lt;gallery&gt;\nLeela2eyes.gif|Leela with two eyes.\nFile:Leela2.png\nFry-Leela-futurama-967816 1024 768.jpg\nlet.jpg\ngred.jpg\nFun on a bun Kiss.jpg|Fry and leela kiss in fun on a bun\nFryLeelaBender.png\nLeela child.gif\nLeela-wristband.jpg\nLeelafry-1.png\nFryandLeelakiss.jpg\nALeelaofHerOwn.jpg\nNibbler and leela.jpg\nLeelahead.png\nLeela in bed with Fry.jpg|Leela in bed with Fry\nLeela in her undies.jpg|Leela in her undies\nLeela and the Genestalk (96).jpg\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n==References==\n&lt;references /&gt;\n\n{{MainCharacters}}\n[[pl:]]\n[[Category:Planet Express Crew]]\n[[Category:Orphans]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Mutants]]\n[[Category:Main Characters]]\n[[Category:Military]]\n[[Category:Blernsball Players]]\n[[Category:Photo Pop Characters]]\n[[Category:Bureaucrats]]\n[[Category:Turanga Family]]\n[[Category:Fry family]]\n[[Category:Futurama]]"

Farnsworth on time travel in general.}}\n'''Roswell that Ends Well''' is the first episode in the [[Season 4 (broadcast)|4th broadcast Season]] of ''[[Futurama]]''. This episode won the 2002 Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour), the show's first Emmy.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe crew is sent back to the year [[1947]] when [[Fry]] puts metal in the ship's microwave while the rest of the crew is watching a supernova explosion. The resultant reaction causes the ship to vanish into a tunnеl, where they pick up a number of clocks before exiting out a portal. Confused, the crew decides to head back to Earth, only to find no space traffic. Worse, there is no receiving signal, so they crash land in Roswell, New Mexico, causing an unsecured [[Bender]] to fly into pieces. While everyone else, including Bender's head, heads back to the ship, Zoidberg is left picking up the pieces. However, at night he is found by the U.S. military. The next day, the crew realizes that the famous crashed UFO that brought Roswell, Area 51, and the related conspiracy theory into popular culture was in fact them. The Professor then explains that the microwave's radiation and the gravitons and graviolois from the supernova blast them through time itself.\n\nThe U.S. military kidnaps Dr. [[Zoidberg]], who was gathering up pieces of Bender's body, and takes him and Bender's body to Roswell Airbase to conduct various experiments, including an alien autopsy and 'UFO reconstruction'. President Truman also arrives to interrogate Zoidberg on either if he comes in peace, staging an invasion or creating a hybrid, but Zoidberg's people skills have him vivisected. &quot;No one is to know about this except the senior officers, scientists and a single nutcase reporter no one will believe.&quot;\n\nWhile the crew looks for another microwave, which they can't find in Roswell, Fry and Bender's head infiltrate the army base. Fry then encounters his grandfather, [[Enos Fry]], who is stationed at the base. As Professor [[Hubert Farnsworth]] had previously warned Fry about causality and the fact that if his grandfather dies, then he will never exist, Fry becomes obsessed with protecting Enos from any possible harm. However, his fear and paranoia result in him overreacting to minor threats and putting Enos in far more danger than he would have been otherwise. He is even more alarmed when Enos exhibits signs of latent homosexuality, making it look unlikely that he will actually father Fry's father. Inadvertently, Fry brings about Enos's death, by leaving him in a &quot;safe&quot; house on a nuclear weapon test range.\n[[File:Mildredfry.jpg|thumb|left|Fry's grandmother and lover, Mildred]]\n\n\nLeela notices that there is microwave dish from the Roswell Airbase and suggests that they steal it but the Professor says that they can't screw up the past in anyway possible. Fry then turns up to inform everyone that he killed Enos. Leela points out that if Enos is dead, then why is he (or given their kinship the professor as well) are still in existence, a question that Fry can't figure out. He then consoles his attractive, beautiful and very sexy would-be grandmother [[Mildred]], who at the time engaged to his grandfather asks him to walk her home. Once there mildred mourns the death of enos however, she hugs fry and soon comes onto to him making him nervous. He tries to talk her out of sex by asking her to bake him sugar cookies but Mildred rips open her dress asks sexually &quot;How about theses cookies sugar?!&quot; (flashing her bra covered breasts to seduce him.) Though disgusted at the thought of incest, fry begin to deduce that since he is alive, the man who died in the nuclear blast could not have been his grandfather. This leads him to believe that Mildred could not be his grandmother. Before he can finish his thoughts, mildred passionately kIsses him and the two have sexual relations on the couch and later the bedroom. The next morning, Fry and Mildred are asleep in bed and are discovered by his disgusted crewmates, with the prompting of the Professor, Fry learns (to his horror) that Mildred is indeed his grandmother, due to the fact that she looked and acted like an old lady. Fry actually became his own grandfather, and is now the father of his own father [[Yancy Fry, Sr.]], making him freak out (though this saves Fry and the Professor and keeps them in existence).\n\nUltimately, Farnsworth gets fed up with causality and decides to steal the dish anyway. They attack the base with the ship, outclassing the 1940s tanks with their superior weapons. Fry and Leela rescue Dr. Zoidberg, with the latter beating up the men performing the vivisection and Fry throwing Zoidberg's organs at Truman; the Professor picks up Bender's body which was due to be sent to Area 51 for study; since this was where the fake Moon landing was to be filmed, Truman invented NASA to land on the moon for real. But as they prepare to travel back to the future, Bender's head accidentally falls out of the Planet Express ship before the time warp, and is left behind in the year 1947. Back in the 31st century, Zoidberg has all but one non-essential organs in him. Fry laments about the loss of Bender, but then hits on a brainwave and the Planet Express crew finds him in the approximate physical location of the Roswell Airbase around the Roswell desert in the 31st century, and re-attaches him to his floating 'UFO' body.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Time-Travel===\nmThis is the first episode that involves ''backward'' time-travel. The first episode involving time-travel was [[Anthology of Interest I]], but that was &quot;fictional&quot; time-travel narrated by the &quot;What If&quot; machine. The first episode involving &quot;real&quot; time-travel was [[Time Keeps on Slippin']], but the chronotons caused time to jump ''forward'' only. Here the Planet Express crew discover that they themselves are the reason for the alien conspiracies surrounding Area 51 in the western United States, while Fry in particular becomes his own grandfather.\n\nAn unexplained time-anomaly occurs in this episode. When Fry has sex with Mildred, she is young. But the next time we see her she is an old woman. So in the span of just a few hours she has aged by many decades while everyone else seems to have aged normally. This may however simply be Fry's own mind playing tricks on him once he realises that he has just had sex with his own grandmother and his remembering what she was like when he knew her.  Either way the only response his crew mates make is one of disgust at the incestuous coupling that has just happened.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry has a one-night stand with Mildred. Leela doesn't seem jealous at all. Disgusted, but not jealous. There has been no sign of feelings between Fry and Leela for a couple of episodes now.\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\n* Bender flies through the windscreen when the Planet Express ship crash-lands on Earth. He is thrown an incredible distance from the ship and is thoroughly dismembered when he himself crashes. However, his individual parts still function, as his arm steals the wallet of a crash-site investigator, and his head nonchalantly accompanies Fry throughout the remainder of the episode. A newspaper photo shows that Bender's shiny, metal ass has suffered no damage.\n* As Farnsworth explains, the time-travel event &quot;tore the universe a new space-hole&quot;.\n* Fry tackles Ennis, knocking him onto a pile of rusty bayonets.\n* Ennis eats Bender's brain.\n* Ennis cuts up the inside of his mouth by eating Bender's brain.\n* Ennis is killed in an atomic blast.\n* Area 51 surgeons perform vivisection on Zoidberg.\n* Leela beats up Zoidberg's two surgeons and President Truman.\n* Bender's head falls out of the Planet Express ship as the ship rockets away from Earth.\n* Zoidberg feigns death to prank Leela.\n* Leela hits Bender in the head with a shovel.\n\n===Character Arcs===\nIn becoming his own grandfather, Fry causes himself to have a genetic abnormality that results in him lacking a &quot;delta brain wave&quot;. This is explained by [[Ken]] the [[Nibblonian]] in [[The Why of Fry]]. Fry's disorder allows him to save Earth in [[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]] by making him immune to the mental attacks of the [[Brain Spawn]], to save the entire universe in The Why of Fry by making him invisible to the Brain Spawn, and to save all life in [[Into the Wild Green Yonder]] by making his mind unreadable by the [[Dark Ones]]. It also potentially explains his stupidity.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Three]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

It originally aired in North America on February 20, 2000.\n\n== Plot ==\nAt a &quot;Past-o-Rama&quot; event, [[Fry]] accidentally runs over a robot that looks exactly like [[Bender]]. His name is [[Flexo]], and he immediately gets along well with Bender. Fry, however, believes that Flexo is evil, especially noting his tendency to constantly insult him, and follow it up with half-hearted, &quot;just kidding,&quot; making a humongous robot stripper give him a painful lap dance, or when he blows chlorine in his face. Later, [[Professor Farnsworth]] hires Flexo to be extra help to guard a beautiful gigantic atom of &quot;jumbonium,&quot; which goes on top of the Miss Universe Pageant winner's tiara. Fry falls asleep on his watch, and when he wakes up, the atom is gone, and so is Flexo. Bender, Fry and Leela search the ship but Fry mistakes that Bender is Flexo because Bender uses a map, turtleneck sweater and a scarf which hides where Flexo's goatee would have been. When they go into the pagent they are pressured by Bob Barker to find the atom before it's too late Fry, Leela, and Bender run into Flexo, and Bender and Flexo are engaged in combat. Not knowing who to shoot, Leela shoots an overhead chandelier, hitting them both. The chandelier ornaments knock Bender's door open, revealing that Bender was the one who stole the jumbonium. Flexo had actually run to tell Bob Barker. However, in the end, the police apprehend Flexo instead, and Bob Barker, saying that he &quot;looks like {the thief}&quot;, had him taken away instead of Bender.\n\n== Production ==\nIn the audio commentary of the show, David X. Cohen states that this episode was the only one to which he gave his artistic input. Halfway through the episode when Fry, Bender and Flexo are at a robot [[strip club]], a robot stripper with a strange gear oriented design can be seen. Cohen claims that he drew the robot himself. [https://archive.is/20121229210228/www.futurama-madhouse.com.ar/grabs/2acv06/2acv06-37.jpg]\n\n== Continuity ==\n*In this episode, Bender mistakes a telephone booth for a suicide booth while at Past-o-Rama.

It was written by [[Ken Keeler]], and directed by [[Chris Louden]]. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n[[Amy]] asks [[Leela]] to help her buy a car at [[Malfunctioning Eddie's Rocket-car Emporium]]. Meanwhile, [[Bender]] decides not to get the recommended safety features installed These would reduce the risk of &quot;catastrophic butt failure,&quot; namely explosion, in a low-speed collision, but it makes his butt look Human. \n    \n[[File:Wrong Side of Mercury.jpg|thumb|Hg's Fuel, 4750 Miles either way]]\nAmy asks [[Fry]] to take a road trip to [[Mercury]], but they break down after they run out of gas. While waiting for a tow truck, she and Fry begin making out.\n\nWith Valentine's Day approaching, Bender decides to start a computer dating service. Fry worries that he and Amy are spending too much time together, and asks Leela to come with them on a picnic to [[Europa]] they had planned. When she refuses, Fry asks [[Zoidberg]] to instead. Zoidberg comes with them, but when Fry asks him to drive he crashes the car. Fry wakes up to find Zoidberg telling him that his body was badly damaged in the crash. Fry, in shock, discovers his head is grafted onto Amy's shoulder in order to be kept alive. After returning to [[Earth]] Fry breaks up with Amy and she makes Valentine's Day plans with another man, [[Gary]].\n\nFry, Amy and Amy's date wind up at [[Elzar's Fine Cuisine]], where all the people who applied to Bender's dating service, including Leela, are with their dates. However, all these dates are flops as Bender merely rounded up a bunch of strangers from the bus station and they all leave for the bus ride home. Amy hits it off with her date, and is about to go home with him over Fry's unwilling protestations. Luckily for Fry, Leela spots him across the room and comes over. She saves Fry by tricking Amy's boyfriend into talking about banking industry regulation. He soon winds up talking about various technical minutiae, distracting him from leaving with Amy. Fry quietly thanks Leela for the assistance.\n\nThe next day, Zoidberg reattaches Fry's head to his now-repaired body, and everything returns to normal. Some of the nerves in Fry's neck were apparently rewired so that Fry's left leg hits him every time he touches his neck. As a result, Fry kicks Bender, and his explosive butt finally blows up saying &quot;MY ASS, MY BEAUTIFUL ASS!&quot;\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\nFry is still not in love with Leela. He asks her out for a Valentine's Day date, but it's a half-hearted request and she angrily refuses. He instead goes for a ride with Amy and they end up having a short-lived affair. Also in this episode, Fry is decapitated in a hovercar accident; Zoidberg attaches Fry's head to Amy's shoulder to keep it alive while Fry's body is repaired. Bender says, &quot;Shut up, Baby, I know it!&quot; for the first time.\n\n== References  ==\n&lt;references /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;This is a reference to Simpsons:Treehouse of Horror XXIV ,,Dead and Shoulders'' where Bart's head is a part of Lisa's body,where in this episode Fry is a part of Amy's body&lt;/nowiki&gt;\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Articles in need of a re-write]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

[Tries to lift the Tea of New Life] Apparently, Amy hasn't been working out much lately... |Kif}}\n\n'''Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch''' is forty-fifth episode of Futurama and the fifth of the [[Season 5 (broadcast)|Season 5]]. It aired on [[Wikipedia:January 11|January 11]], [[Wikipedia:2003|2003]] in North America.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Amy]] flies into the lounge on her [[party board]], having came back from another party. She learns that [[Kif]] called, but [[Bender]] had failed to report it. The [[Professor]] comes in, telling the crew that they will be delivering large pain pills to [[Nigel 7]], near where Kif is stationed. Amy asks to accompany the crew, but the Professor states that this is a delivery company, not a taxi service, and goes upstairs to vent in the [[Planet Express building|angry dome]]. Nonetheless, Amy sneaks on board the [[Planet Express ship]] and takes control while everyone else is sleeping in hibernative naptosis, directing it towards the [[Nimbus]]. When [[Zapp Brannigan]] sees the ship, he allows them to dock. He appears in [[Leela]]'s room, attempting to seduce her again, only to be slapped. Meanwhile, Kif shows Amy the [[Holo-shed]] to show her what life would be like with him in different scenarios. However, the shed malfunctions and the holograms, [[Attila the Hun]], [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Professor Moriarty]], and [[Evil Lincoln]], become real and follow the couple to the bridge. Zapp threatens to fire a laser gun. Attila warns him &quot;No shoot fire stick in space canoe. Cause explosive decompression!&quot; but Zapp doesn't listen and blasts a hole in the wall. The holographic characters get sucked through the hole, while Zapp and the [[Planet Express crew]] hold onto each other like a chain. Kif, having lost a glove, gets sucked towards the hole; everyone attempts to grab him but are unsuccessful. Luckily, the holographic moon from the Holo-shed plugs up the hole, stopping the decompression. At the infirmary later, the doctor announces that Kif is pregnant.\n[[File:Matern.jpg|thumb|right|The Maternifuge.]]\n\nBender, furious that his understanding of how organics mate is corrupted, attempts to attack Kif but is restrained. Kif explains that whenever his species, [[Amphibiosans]], feel love, it stimulates their nerve, enabling them to reproduce through touch. Though it is initially believed that Amy is the mother, as Fry points out, everyone on the ship touched Kif so it is unclear who the mother is. Back on [[Earth]], the Professor uses an invention of his, the [[Maternifuge]], to determine who is the real mother and discovers it is Leela, after Fry, Zapp, Zoidberg, (because he lives there) and Amy get shot out. Kif realizes that she had touched his ungloved hand during the decompression but doesn't care, as his species see the [[smizmar]] as the stimulus, which happens to be Amy.\n\nThe crew has a baby shower at Fry and Bender's [[Robot Arms Apts|apartment]]. Amy's parents are most excited to finally have grandchildren. But they remade her party board into an ironing board, which they describe as a 'wave of responsibility'. After Kif tells everyone an emotional speech about his new life with Amy, which moves Zoidberg to tears, Amy decides she can't go through with being a parent and runs away, leaving Kif just as his babies are about to be born.\n\n[[Planet Express]] escorts Kif to the planet where he was born, [[Amphibios 9]] and just as Kif is about to give birth, Amy appears, saying she wants to be with him. After Kif gives birth, the babies, in a tadpole-like state, are nearly attacked by predators but Amy and Leela fend them off. The kids are left to swim about until they grow up; twenty years. Two of Kif's babies collide in the water, exhibiting Amy's klutzy behavior; then one swims in front of the camera and blinks a cyclopian eye. This suggests that in truth, Leela and Amy both contributed their DNA.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Injury, Death===\n* Twice, Amy dismounts her party board badly and lands on her face.\n* On the holodeck, the moon falls out of the sky and lands on Kif's head.\n* History's greatest villains are all sucked into space when Brannigan blasts a hole in the ships hull.\n* Everyone else on the bridge survives, but at the cost of &quot;a few broken bones, some internal hemorrhaging, and a partially barfed-up heart&quot;, according to the ship's doctor, and as is later revealed, the decapitation of Bender.\n* Farnsworth takes a &quot;DNA&quot; sample so large from Kif that it causes Kif's head to collapse.\n* Everyone but Leela is flung bodily from the maternifuge.\n* Leela elbows Brannigan in the gut.\n* A poisonous froad attempts to eat Bender.\n* Kif overextends his arms while dragging the jug of the tea of new life to the fire.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\nThe Grand Midwife appears for the first time.

It originally aired in North America on February 27, 2000.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nAt the morning [[Planet Express]] meeting, the [[Planet Express crew]] discovers [[Hermes]] has been assimilated by the [[brain slugs]]. To avoid Hermes' slack-jawed stare and being assimilated themselves, the rest of the staff takes off for the movies.\n\nWhile watching [[All My Circuits: The Movie]], Bender picks a fight with a [[robot]] that turns out to be [[Ultimate Robot Fighting]] champion [[The Masked Unit]]. The Masked Unit trips on Bender's oil-soaked popcorn and is knocked out by the fall. Coincidentally, the commissioner of Ultimate Robot Fighting, [[Abner Doubledeal]] is at the movie and hires Bender on the spot.\n\nAfter training with [[Leela]], Bender has his first fight against a chainsaw-equipped robot called [[The Clearcutter]]. By a stroke of luck, Bender defeats his opponent, causing The Clearcutter to explode into a pile of parts. However, Bender runs into the robot backstage and the commissioner reveals that Ultimate Robot Fighting is fixed, as well as that the most popular robot always wins.\n\nBender spurns further training from Leela and proceeds to win several fights, but eventually his popularity wanes and he is told that he can either take a dive in his new role as 'The Gender Bender', or be killed by his giant opponent, [[Destructor]]. Bender asks Leela for help, but she initially refuses. When she discovers that Destructor is being trained by Arcturan Kung Fu [[Master Fnog]], she changes her mind. The male chauvinist and genderist Master Fnog had ruined Leela's dream of competing in the Arcturan Kung Fu junior championships years ago and Leela still holds a grudge.\n\nWhile Bender is being thrashed by Destructor, Bender asks Fry to throw in the towel but he finds out that Fry has a Brain Slug on his head. Leela discovers that Destructor is being controlled remotely using motion capture and virtual reality by Fnog. They proceed to fight, but just as Fnog is winning, Leela uses Fnog's own fist to force Destructor to punch him, knocking them both out. Destructor, however, fell on and flattened Bender, thus winning the match anyway. After the fight, Fry and Leela roll up the flattened Bender and carry him home\n\n== Debut Appearances ==\n* [[Abner Doubledeal]]\n* [[Bender]] as Bender the Offender/the Gender Bender\n* [[Billionaire Bot]]\n* [[Chain Smoker]]\n* [[The Clearcutter]]\n* [[Destructor]]\n* [[Master Fnog]]\n* [[Foreigner]]\n* [[George Foreman's head]]\n* [[Gorgeous Gonks]]\n* [[The Masked Unit]]\n* [[Sergeant Feces Processor]]\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The title is a parody of the 1980 movie ''Raging Bull'' and a reference to an alcohol-induced headache, as well as a tongue-in-cheek joke on &quot;raging boner.&quot;\n* The Ultimate Robot Fighting is a reference to the UFC in name, although the actual product is much more similar to professional wrestling, given the characters, ring, merchandising, character changes and predetermined outcomes that are shown. It is also a parody of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlebots BattleBots].\n* The commissioner of the Ultimate Robot Fighting League is a parody of Vince McMahon.\n* The referee is a stripe-painted alien that is the [[Amphibiosans|same species]] as [[Kif Kroker]]. Besides the obvious physical resemblance, he also announces the beginning of the first fight, &quot;Ladies, Gentlemen, and [[Smizmar]]s!&quot; which seems to indicate a link to that people.\n* The characters who serve as Bender's opponents are typical of many pro wrestling characters that have appeared over time on World Wrestling Entertainment. For instance, Billionaire Bot is a parody of The Million Dollar Man, while The Foreigner is a jab at such personified racial stereotypes as The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff.\n* &quot;RobotMania XXII&quot; is a parody of WrestleMania and possibly a reference to the Super Bowl's use of Roman numerals in its annual titles.\n* The Masked Unit's line, &quot;I'm gonna open a file of whoop-ass on you!&quot;, is a parody of wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin.\n* There is another reference to Stone Cold Steve Austin in the Bender 3:16 shirt worn by a person in the crowd. It is a parody of t-shirts created by the WWE based on Austin's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin#Austin_3:16_and_rise_to_superstardom_.281996.E2.80.931997.29 3:16 speech] after winning the King of the Ring PPV in 1996.\n* Bender references boxing announcer Michael Buffer's most famous line: &quot;Let's get ready to rumble!&quot;\n* When the crew goes to the movies they see movie posters and Marquee listings for a variety of movies, mostly parodies of other films:\n:* ''Planet of the Clams'' is a reference to ''Planet of the Apes'' about &quot;an upside down world where lobster is slave to clam&quot;: the reference to lobsters may imply it is a film from Decapod 10, home of Zoidberg's lobster-like race.\n:* ''Galaxy Wars'' is a historical documentary, the title is a reference to ''Star Wars''.\n:* ''Quizblorg, Quizblorg'', a foreign film with subtitles, possibly a reference to the fictional foreign film &quot;Rochelle, Rochelle&quot; from Seinfeld.\n:* ''When a Man Loves a Smizmar'', a reference to ''When a Man Loves a Woman''. Also, a [[Smizmar]] is a term used in &quot;[[Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch]]&quot; to describe the person who caused the feelings of love allowing a male of Kif's species to become pregnant.\n* The opening to ''All My Circuits, The Movie'' is a parody of James Bond films, in particular ''The Spy Who Loved Me.''\n* Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo from ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' appear in silhouette in the movie theater as they normally do on their TV show. Crow's harsh demand that Fry not talk during the movie is an ironic statement since the entire crux of their show is to talk during the movie. Neither Joel Robinson nor Mike Nelson can be seen though and Crow is not voiced by either Trace Beaulieu nor Bill Corbett. Furthermore, Fry's comment of 'Oh, this is SO futuristic' is a reference to MST3k's brand of making fun of various problems in the B-movies that the show often reviews.\n* The ad announcing Bender's persona change to &quot;The Gender Bender&quot; starts with Bender standing on the planet Earth with the Earth flag waving behind him. This pose is identical to the George Reeves Superman pose at the start of each episode of the 1950s television series ''Adventures of Superman''.\n* The Loews theater the crew goes to is called the (&lt;math&gt;\\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;)PLEX, a reference to the first aleph number, the least infinite cardinal number and dubbed on the commentary for the episode as the nerdiest joke ever on television.\n* Hermes' brain slug could be an indirect reference to the slug-like young ceti eels that Khan uses on Chekov and Terrell in ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' (although in that case, they enter through the ear, but still affected the brain). Hermes first encountered a brain slug in an earlier episode, ''[[A Head in the Polls]]''.\n* Master Funog is a parody of sensei Miyagi from the Karate Kid series of movies.\n*When the fight rages out in the middle of the theater, [[Hattie McDoogal]] shouts &quot;let's all go to the lobby!&quot;. This is a reference to the 1953 animated snipe, &quot;Let's All Go to the Lobby&quot;.\n*Bender's line, &quot;Float like a float bot, sting like an automated stinging machine.&quot; parodies Muhammad Ali's famous quote, &quot;Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.&quot; Bender also references how he is going to be the greatest and Ali's nickname was &quot;The Greatest.&quot;\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Articles in need of a re-write]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

It originally aired in North America on May 21, 2000. This episode, as well as the later &quot;[[Anthology of Interest II]]&quot;, serves to showcase three out-of-canon &quot;imaginary&quot; stories, in a manner similar to the &quot;[[Wikipedia:Treehouse of Horror|Treehouse of Horror]]&quot; episodes of [[Matt Groening]]'s other animated series [[The Simpsons]].\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Prologue ===\n[[Professor Farnsworth]] invites the employees of [[Planet Express]] to see his new invention: the [[Fing-Longer]], an index-finger-extending glove. As he tries it out, it activates a TV-like device. When [[Fry]] questions the Professor regarding what it is, he explains that it is the [[&quot;What If&quot; Machine]], a device that allows the user to view a simulation of a short hypothetical scenario after the user asks it a 'what-if' question. The Professor then invites the crew to try out the What-If Machine.\n\n=== Terror at 500 Feet ===\n[[Bender]] jumps at the chance and asks the What-If Machine what would happen if he were 500 feet tall. The simulation begins with the giant Bender being built by hundreds of smaller Benders. He flies and crashes onto Central Park and meeting with a recently unfrozen Fry. After some friendly [[Wikipedia:Frisbee|Frisbee]] fun, the military is sent to deal with him.\n\nBender begins to wreak havoc upon [[New New York]]. To combat Bender, the Professor uses his enlarging-ray upon a hapless Dr. Zoidberg, enlarging him, only to see him wreak havoc as well, interrupted only by Bender who isn't pleased with Zoidberg destroying 'his' city. The two start to fight and Bender appears to win by pushing Zoidberg into a stadium of boiling water.\n[[File:Anthology.jpg|thumb|Zoidberg and Bender fight on a city-wide scale.]]\n\nWhile Bender laughs in triumph, he is distracted by Fry. An enraged Zoidberg rises out of the water and snaps off Bender's feet. This causes him to fall on the Empire State Building, which appears to stab him. A tearful Fry admonishes the citizens of New New York City about the tragedy of Bender's death, whose final words lament about his inability to fulfill his purpose, which is to kill all humans. The scenario then ends.\n\n=== Dial L for Leela ===\nThe Professor asks [[Leela]] to try out the What-If machine. Leela initially declines, but at the prompting of Fry, Leela decides to ask what would happen if she were a little more impulsive.\n\nThe scenario starts at Planet Express, where Leela shows off her new boots bought on impulse, the only difference being a green stripe down the side. The Professor summons Leela to tell her that she is to be made his sole heir as she is so &quot;unimpulsive&quot; -- only to be kicked by Leela into a pit containing his man-eating anteaters, where he is promptly devoured. She tries acting like nothing's happened but [[Hermes]] finds that the Professor was murdered, so [[Zoidberg]] takes up detective work. As Hermes discovers her role in the death in a video will, she is forced to silence him by chopping him up and plunging his remains down the drain. She impulsively murders Bender using a microwave with a broken frame in order to keep him from blackmailing her about the deaths and makes him into a cart to &quot;hide the corpse&quot;. Amy makes fun at Leela, so she is murdered as well.\n\nZoidberg summons the rest of the [[Planet Express crew]] into the [[Planet Express Building#Areas|Accusing Parlor]] in order to solve the murders. While Zoidberg reveals clues, [[Cubert]], [[Scruffy]] and even [[Nibbler]] attempt to implicate Leela, only to be slain by her when she turns off the lights. Zoidberg finds a letter from recently deceased Bender about the identity of the murderer but is interrupted by Fry who leaves due to boredom: Leela murders Zoidberg as well, eating him. When Fry finally figures out the next day that she was responsible, Leela is forced to do something really impulsive: sleep with him to keep him quiet. Fry declares that he likes the new, impulsive Leela. She then ominously asks Fry to turn off the lights. Fry does so and promptly begins screaming — and then says that he really likes her.\n\n=== The Un-Freeze of a Lifetime ===\n[[File:Gore Gygax Hawking Nichols.jpg|thumb|Promotional artwork for the episode]]\nAfter being told that Bender's scenario would not be done again, Fry asks what would happen if he had not &quot;fallen into the freezer-doodle and come to the future-jiggy&quot;. The scenario starts with Fry narrowly missing falling into the [[cryogenic tube]] and a rift in the space-time continuum appears, which shows the Planet Express crew in the future wondering what is causing the rift and Fry horrified at seeing monsters.\n[[File:VPAR.jpg|thumb|right|The Vice Presidential Action Rangers, minus Deep Blue]]\nThe next day, after talking to his boss, [[Mr. Panucci]], he came to the attention of [[Stephen Hawking_(character)|Stephen Hawking]] who arranges for Fry to be abducted. Once abducted, he is introduced to the [[Vice Presidential Action Rangers]], led by [[Al Gore_(character)|Al Gore]], with Stephen Hawking, [[Nichelle Nichols_(character)|Nichelle Nichols]], [[Gary Gygax_(character)|Gary Gygax]] and [[Deep Blue]], whose task is to protect the space-time continuum, now threatened by the rifts which are caused by &quot;events that are supposed to happen but didn't&quot;.\n\nAfter Fry explains what happened the previous night at [[Applied Cryogenics]], the Vice Presidential Action Rangers determine that Fry was supposed to die and try to kill him, only to be proven wrong when another rift appears during the attempted killing. Nichols then suggests that Fry be frozen and Gygax gives Fry his +1 mace for protection against drunken robots in the future. Just before Fry freezes himself, he smashes the cryogenic tube, causing the universe to collapse into a space-time rift. This results in Fry and the Vice Presidential Action Rangers appearing at some other indeterminate dimension which is not part of the universe. The scenario ends with them playing [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] for the rest of eternity, or at least the first quadrillion years of their imprisonment there.\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nAfter the end of Fry's scenario, the Professor curses the What-If machine for simulating scenarios even he found preposterous and dumped it into the trash can. He promptly judges the Fing-Longer to be a rousing success and is congratulated by the crew. We find out that everything before was just a simulation by the What-If machine when the professor asked what would have happened if he had invented the Fing-Longer, leaving him to lament about the possibilities if he had invented it.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*The sign in [[Alienese]] reads, &quot;Rent A Human&quot;.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Hermes-isms===\n* ''Sweet giant anteater of Santa Anita''\n\n===Doppelgängers===\nThe 500-foot-tall Bender is constructed by an army of normal-sized Benders.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nThe writers of this episode managed to get Fry and Leela together for the ultimate no-strings-attached sex. They have sex, but only in the &quot;fictional&quot; story told by the &quot;What If&quot; machine.\n\n===Time-travel===\nThis is the first episode involving time-travel, not counting Fry's initial journey. But it is not &quot;real&quot; time-travel: it is a fiction generated by the &quot;What If&quot; machine.\n== See also ==\n*[[Anthology of Interest II]]\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Featured articles]]\n[[Category:Season Two|Anthology of Interest I]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

It is the follow up to Anthology of Interest I which aired in 2000.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Professor Farnsworth]] has hauled out his [[What If Machine|What-if Machine]] again, and the [[Planet Express crew]] takes a look at three alternate realities.\n\n=== I, Meatbag ===\n[[File:Humanbender.jpg|thumb|left|Bender as a human]]\n[[Bender]] asks what would happen if he were [[human]].\n\nProfessor Farnsworth announces that he has invented a process of reverse fossilization, which can turn metal robots into organic life-forms. He uses his reverse fossilization machine on Bender, who is successfully transformed into a human.\n\nAfter a short period of adaptation, Bender's self-control is overwhelmed by his new senses of taste, touch and emotional responses, and goes on a sensory input binge. A week later, at the Academy of Science [[Wikipedia:Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize]] judging, the Professor presents Bender, who has become a thousand-pound blob.\n\nThe committee initially condemns the Professor, but Bender begs them to consider his new lifestyle. The open-minded scientists spend the night in a state of wild hedonism. Just before dawn, the committee awards Bender his own Nobel Prize. They discover that he died shortly after the party started: his excited &quot;Woo&quot; was just the sound of air escaping the folds of his fat.\n\n=== Raiders of the Lost Arcade ===\n[[File:FryAOI2.jpg|thumb|right|Fry is ready to fight the Nintendians]]\n[[Fry]] wants to see a world that is more like a video game because that is the only thing he is good at.\n\nAs the simulation starts, [[President of Earth]], [[Richard Nixon's head]], is preparing to sign a treaty with [[Ambassador Kong]] of planet [[Nintenduu 64]]. Ambassador Kong attacks Nixon, and a state of war erupts with the ambassador for Italy (Mario) expressing his distress.\n\nDue to his extensive knowledge of video games, Fry is brought to the 'milatari' headquarters and introduced to [[General Colin Pac-Man]]. Before Fry can impart his wisdom to the military, the [[Nintendians]] launch an attack on [[Washington, D.C.]], and they are forced into the escape tunnels that resemble a Pac-Man maze.\n\nThey emerge outside the [[Planet Express building]], where the [[space invaders]], led by [[Lrrr]], are blasting [[New New York]]. Fry situates himself at the controls of a rolling AAA platform and begins destroying the alien ships.\n\nUnfortunately for [[Earth]], Fry is unable to destroy the last ship (his brother always used to get it for him) which lands, conquering Earth. After Fry enters &quot;ASS&quot; as his initials for his high score, the invaders emerge, with one stating &quot;All your base are belong to us.&quot; They demand millions of dollars in quarters, but the [[Earth]]icans refuse, as they need the quarters to do their laundry. A compromise is reached, with the Nintendians throwing their laundry in with Earth's.\n\n=== Wizzin' ===\n[[File:PHOTO_NO-1.jpg|thumb|left|Parody of the Wicked Witch]][[Leela]] wants to see her true home. When the Professor pulls the lever on the What-if Machine, he whacks her in the head, and she falls to the floor unconscious.\n\nShe wakes up at the helm of the [[Planet Express ship]], which is caught in a tornado. It crash lands in a technicolor wonderland, crushing the [[Man-Witch of the West]], Scruffy. [[The Cute Witch of the North]], Amy, tells her that she should seek out the Professor, who lives in the [[Emerald Laboratory]] down [[Martin Luther King Boulevard]], which is constructed from yellow brick.\n\nWhile traveling, she meets a scarecrow, Fry, a mechanical man, Bender, and &quot;the other guy&quot;, Zoidberg. [[The Wicked Witch]], [[Mom]], sends her winged monkeys, [[Walt]], [[Larry]], and [[Igner]], to kidnap Leela and her friends. The Wicked Witch always wanted a daughter, and offers to take Leela in. Leela accepts, and as part of a celebration, Leela sets down a bucket of water. Under tremendous pressure, the water shoots out of the bottle and lands on the Wicked Witch, causing her to melt.\n\nFalling back to the original plan, the crew make their way to the Emerald Laboratory. There they meet the great and forgetful Professor. The Professor tells Leela that she can go home by clicking her ruby boots together and wishing to go home. She says: &quot;There's no place like...

However, this year, Mom, bitter about a romantic affair that had ended [[2931|70 years prior]], orders the entire [[robots|Robot population]] of [[Earth]] to rebel and overthrow humanity through a [[Universal Robot Controller]] that transmits to every robots' antennas. This doomed romance had been with a younger Professor [[Hubert J. Farnsworth]], then an employee of the Friendly Robot Company. When Mom insisted that the Professor's latest design, a children's toy named [[Q.T. McWhiskers]], be changed to an eight-foot-tall death machine to be sold on the intergalactic arms market, the Professor, enraged, stormed out of the room, and they hadn't seen each other again since.\n\nWishing to end the Robot rebellion and save humanity, Mom's three sons, [[Walt]], [[Larry]], and [[Ignar|Igner]], cooperate with the [[Planet Express crew]] to obtain the robot control Mom keeps in her bra. Their plan is to bring Mom to her rustic cabin in [[the Bronx]], have the Professor seduce her, remove her bra, and use the control to end the rebellion. They give the crew a non-computer-drawn map. Deprived of technology, the crew must be guided by Fry's 20th Century low-tech knowledge. He builds a wagon, albeit with oval wheels, and brings the Professor to the Bronx.\n\nWhen the Professor and Mom meet, their love is rekindled. Despite a reenactment of their parting argument, they erupt into a &quot;whirlwind of hot, dry sex&quot;. Everyone else comes in because the Robots had made their way to the Bronx. They search everywhere for her thrown bra and find it on a fan, which evades their attempts to grab the bra. Mom stops the rebellion, but dumps the Professor after learning of their plot. Back at Planet Express, the Professor engineered albino-shouting gorillas to yell Mom's name from the rooftops.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Farnsworth and Mom===\nIt is first revealed that Farnsworth and Mom have a past together, and Farnsworth still carries a torch.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Mom Episodes]]"

[Whimpers]|Soldier}}\n\n'''War is the H-Word''' is episode seventeen in [[Season Two]] of Futurama. It originally aired in North America on November 26, 2000. The episode parodies several war films and shows, including [[Wikipedia:Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]], [[Wikipedia:Patton (film)|Patton]] and [[Wikipedia:M*A*S*H|M*A*S*H]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAs part of an attempt to scam a [[7¹¹]] store, [[Fry]] and [[Bender]] enlist in the [[Earth Army]]. However, before they can use their 5% military discount to buy chewing gum, [[Earth]] declares war on [[Spheron I]] - a planet that commanding General [[Zapp Brannigan]] says, to his troops, is devoid of any natural resources, and possesses no strategic importance whatsoever, but is willing to put troopers' lives at risk for no reason.\n\nConcerned for her friends' safety, [[Leela]] attempts to enlist, but the Army has a men-only policy. While Earth's flagship, the [[Nimbus]], makes its way to the enemy planet, the soldiers undergo training, and we discover that Leela has sneaked aboard disguised as a man, under the name of [[Lee Lemon]], to whom Brannigan finds himself strangely attracted.\n\nThey arrive and discover the enemy is a race of pink, sentient, ball-like creatures. In their first battle Fry fails to stop an attack and instead blows a hole in the ground to hide. Bender manages to stop an enemy bomb by covering it with himself. For his act of cowardice, Brannigan sentences Fry to a demeaning punishment that is more gruesome than being his assistant - being [[Kif]]'s assistant. Kif takes this opportunity to be very strict towards Fry.\n\nAfter the initial battle with the balls, the soldiers regroup at camp. The Commander-in-chief, [[President of Earth]] [[Richard M. Nixon's head]], sends Bender and [[Henry Kissinger's head]] to negotiate with the [[Spheron]] leaders, the [[Brain Balls]].\n\nBrannigan, however, tells everyone the true plan. A voice-activated bomb has been planted inside of Bender and will detonate, destroying the whole planet, when Bender says his favorite word: &quot;ass&quot;. As the DOOP evacuates, Fry thinks up a plan to steal a helicopter and knock out the guards, only for &quot;Lee Lemon&quot; to act out his entire plan. &quot;Lemon&quot; asks Fry if he recognizes &quot;him&quot; but Fry incorrectly thinks [[Hermes]]. Zapp spots them and, seeing them holding hands and angry at their betrayal, prepares to arrest them. When &quot;Lemon&quot; beats him up and reveals &quot;his&quot; identity as Leela, Zapp utters &quot;Leela! So it's ''you'' I've been attracted to. Oh God, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman.&quot;\n\nThe two fly to the negotiating-hall. Fry, pushed out of the helicopter by Leela, is determined to prove that he is a man. He hops on one of the balls towards the conference. He manages to inform Bender of the plot just in time before he utters his favorite phrase; Kissinger congratulates Fry for his bravery. However, Bender, who has gotten bored with the ball leaders talking about bouncing, realizes that he now has the power to make the Brain-balls surrender. Though Spheron I is actually the brain balls' homeworld and it is the humans who are the &quot;evil invading aliens&quot;, Bender simply demands that they &quot;get the hell off my planet!&quot;, and they all evacuate, bouncing into space. A [[New New York Post]] headline reads &quot;War Over! Balls Thoroughly Licked!&quot;.\n\nBack at the Planet Express office, Professor Farnsworth cannot remove the bomb from Bender's body because it is stuck with glue. Instead, he resets the bomb from a list of words Bender hardly ever uses. Bender asks what it is but the crew refuses to tell him. The word is &quot;'antiquing'&quot;, which Bender successfully guesses.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*The tent reads &quot;M*E*A*T&quot; in [[Alienese]].\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nWhile eating in the mess hall, Fry mentions that he &quot;has a thing&quot; for a girl back home.

She doesn't show any sign of being interested in Fry; she just seems touched by the sentiment.\n\n===Deaths, near-deaths, mutilations===\nSurrounded by the Planet Express crew, Bender detonates the planet-destroying bomb inside his body.

This episode reveals [[Turanga Leela|Leela's]] true origin as a [[mutant]], not an [[alien]] as previously believed.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n[[Professor Hubert Farnsworth|The Professor]] announces that [[Leela]]'s childhood home, [[Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium]], has named her Orphan of the Year. In another announcement, he shows off a machine that makes phosphorescent glow-in-the-dark noses. Unfortunately, the machine produces enormous amounts of toxic waste. Hermes, being a bureaucrat, demands that the Professor dispose of the waste or bribe him, which either way costs $500. [[Bender]] agrees to dispose of the waste for &quot;$499 and 100 cents,&quot; and he does so by dumping it into the sewer.\n\nAt the orphanarium's award ceremony, the headmaster presents us with a flashback of Leela's arrival. We see that she was left with a note written in [[Alienese]], and a bracelet. Back at the Planet Express building, Leela is in tears over not having parents. [[Fry]] takes her for a walk, and she looks up to the stars, wondering which alien world her parents were from. The camera pans back down, and we see two one-eyed sewer mutants looking up from a drain.\n\nMeanwhile, Bender has expanded his one-time dumping into a full waste management service. The mutants grow angry with Bender's disposal technique, and make a rare surface trip, capturing Bender, Fry, and Leela. The mutants sentence the crew to be lowered into a lake of chemicals, which will turn them into mutants as well. Bender, who was still scared, had no DNA; but the mutants said they were going to beat him up later.\n\nTwo hooded mutants call out to Leela, then swing the crane around, dropping the crew on the far side of the mutagenic lake. The mutant mob, immune to the effects of the lake, dive in and swim across. Fry, Leela, and Bender take refuge in a mutant home, where they find a shrine to Leela's life. The mob captures them, but after a whispered word from the hooded mutants, the crew's sentence is commuted to exile. They ride a hot-air balloon to a surface access ladder hanging over the lake. Fry and Bender emerge on the surface; but Leela, determined to find out what the hooded mutants know, dives into the chemical lake.\n\nShe swims to shore, and finds she is unaffected by the chemicals. Fry heads to the orphanarium to try to get some clues as to what's going on, and the headmaster gives him the note that was left with Leela. Fry takes the note back to the Professor for analysis. As they read the analysis output, we learn the truth: Leela is actually a mutant, but was born &quot;the least mutated mutant ever&quot;. Her parents, realizing she could pass as an alien, decided to leave her at the orphanarium and using Munda's background in exolinguistics, left an Alienese note. They agreed that they would rather die than ever let her find out the &quot;shameful&quot; truth.\n\nMeanwhile, an armed and irrational Leela has pursued the hooded mutants through the sewers, back to the home with the shrine to herself. Leela comes to the irrational conclusion that the mutants killed her parents, leaving her an orphan. She plans to kill her parents, and both are willing to let her rather than reveal the truth. Fry falls through the ceiling at the last second and reveals the truth. He takes off the mutants' hoods revealing two middle-age one-eyed mutants. A tearful reunion ensues, and the episode closes with a montage of scenes of Leela's parents watching over their daughter during her life. As a baby, they saved her from falling. As a child, they gave her cookies. As a teenager, they gave her a present for her birthday. As an adult, they covered her with the quilt.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*The note Turanga Munga left on Leela's basket reads, &quot;Your parents love you very much&quot; in Alienese.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* This is the episode where it is revealed that Leela is in fact an earthling, a mutant, daughter of sewer mutants, rather than the offspring of an unknown species of alien.\n* A mouse is dunked into the sewer's mutagenic water and emerges as a fish-pig-monster thing.\n* Leela dives into the mutagenic water and emerges as an octopus-monster, but only apparently, as upon emerging she removes the octopus-monster from her head and is her normal self.\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\n* Baby Leela kicks the headmaster in the face.\n* The orphan Albert runs blindly into a wall.\n* Bender uses Fry's body to break a window.\n* [[Leg Mutant]] kicks Fry in the leg.\n* Leela incapacitates a nameless three-eyed mutant with a kick to the head.\n* Bender dumps garbage on top of Leela.\n* With unspecified help from Bender, Fry crashes through the Turangas' ceiling and lands on their floor in a pile of rubble.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nLeela opens up to Fry when he tries to cheer her up. But she seems to need only a friend. Fry's version of cheering Leela up involves innuendo, but he eventually manages to rise to the occasion and behave as a friend.\n\nIn the home of Leela's parents, there is a sort of shrine composed of items Leela has flushed down the toilet throughout her life. Fry notices on this shrine a letter from himself to Leela, which he describes as &quot;full of my personal feelings.&quot; It's not clear whether these are personal feelings in general, or toward her in particular. Either way, it's clear how she feels about him, in spite of the occasional romantic sparks that have flown in previous episodes.\n\nWhen Leela returns to the mutants, Fry makes an effort to &quot;save&quot; her, as he is under the impression that she has gone crazy.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

The DNA used to clone him was scraped from a growth on the Professor's back in [[2989]], and this is the day that is celebrated in lieu of an actual birthday. His nose is flattened due to the Professor accidentally leaving him in one of his earlier cloning tubes for too long.\n\nHe is a chubby boy with ginger hair in a similar style to Fry's. He has chubby cheeks, and usually wears a watch and a light blue t-shirt with a Helium atom on it. He wears dark blue shorts and red trainers.\n\nHe is the sole heir to [[Planet Express]] and Professor Farnsworth fortune, as he is Professor Farnsworth's closest living relative. He spends most of his time within the [[Planet Express building]] with the [[Planet Express crew]], and during his first appearance, [[A Clone of My Own]], appeared to criticize everything. He seems highly intelligent, but in reality he is usually just pointing out the logical flaws in the behaviors and actions of others, and the ways in which his father's inventions defy the laws of science.\n\nCubert is best friends with his classmate [[Dwight]], the son of [[Hermes]] and [[LaBarbara Conrad]]. In an attempt to prove they are better than their parents, they go into business together. The result: the short-lived delivery company [[Awesome Express]].

Due to a severe staffing problem they provide a cold and uncaring environment for children. It is the orphanarium where [[Leela]] was left as a small child.\n\nWhen invited back to the orphanarium as part of a reunion celebration, Leela is officially recognized as one of the most successful orphans. During this time [[Bender]] overhears talk of the government grants one can receive if one adopts a child. This encourages him to adopt twelve of the current orphans.\nLater, he returns the children to the orphanarium along with a donation of $1200 in compensated support payments. In response to this large donation, [[Warden Vogel]] renamed the building the ''Bender Bending Rodríguez Orphanarium''.\n\nThe name of the orphanarium was apparently changed back at some point. Though the reason for the name change isn't explained in any episode, the sign out front once again reads: Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium in later episodes.\n\nThe orphans have no books to read, because they ate them to avoid starvation.\n\n[[Abner Doubledeal]] uses the orphans to conduct audience research for television shows. Leela met him at the orphanarium while she was telling a story about [[The Humplings]]. Abner Doubledeal turned it into a TV show on Tickleodeon.\n\n[[Sally]] was inspired by Leela to write her own story. This caused Leela to be overcome with guilt and reveal The Humplings were real aliens she had been stealing stories from.\n\nWhen Leela revealed this, Abner Doubledeal made a deal with The Humplings to film their lives for television.

But he went straight for you! He didn't even try to second-degree murder me!&quot;|Fry}}\n\n'''&quot;The Honking&quot;''' is episode eighteen in [[Season Two]] of Futurama. It originally aired in North America on November 5, 2000. \n\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Bender]] learns that his uncle [[Vladimir]] had died. He and friends journey to his castle in [[Thermostadt]] for his funeral and the reading of the will. After a short talk, they encase Vladimir's chassis in a box filled with Styrofoam. The next day, the lawyer reads the will; the butler, [[You There]] gets a very small pittance, his son [[Tandy]] is given his entire ten million dollar fortune; Bender, who Vladimir assumes is not responsible for his death, is given the family [[Thermostadt Castle|castle]] under the condition that he spends one night within its walls.\n\nThat night, Bender is enjoying the castle, until he sees a painting's eyes move, blood numerals written backwards and the ghosts of the castle's paintings come to life. When he runs away, the [[Planet Express crew]] investigates and find out that the poorly protected robots' programmings leaked through the castle's wiring where they could appear as holograms. They try to explain this to Bender, but he runs past them onto the moors; encountering a car that drives on four wheels, &quot;Like a wolf!!&quot;\n\nWhen they come back to [[New New York]], Bender thinks the car has followed him. That night, two vandals are wrecking [[hover car]]s, when a rubber wheeled car attacks them. The next day, Bender finds himself in Impound Lot 136, soaking in transmision fluid. Seeking help, he goes to a [[Robot Gypsy]], who tells him he has become a [[were-car]]. Every night when the clock strikes zero, his clock will reboot and the transformation will take place. Soon he will be compelled to kill his best friend, the Gypsy tells him. The only way to cure him is to seek out and destroy the original, so its uninstalling program can get rid of the curse.\n\nThe next night, [[Fry]] and [[Leela]] weld Bender to a wall in his apartment, but it doesn't stop him from transforming. Instead of going after Fry, he goes after Leela. They're chased into the Park Avenue junkyard, and manage to subdue him with a huge claw. The next morning, Fry is very angry at Bender for not trying to kill him. They return to Thermostadt to hunt down the original were-car. They track the trail to an old birdwatcher, who got his curse from the North Pole, where people call the were-car [[the Abominable Snowmobile]]. The robot there tells them she got the curse from [[Calculon]]. In [[Hollywood]], Calculon confesses he was run over by the original were-car a thousand years ago. He changes his appearance every two decades so no one gets suspicious. When Calculon was a car manufacturing machine, he assisted in creating the most evil of cars, [[Project Satan]]. Some of its parts were a steering wheel from Adolf Hitler's Mercedes Benz, the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW bus and the windshield wiper from that car that played Knight Rider. It ran over Calculon, the first victim. He told them that Project Satan can be found in either France or the old abandoned Chrysler factory.\n\nThe crew locates the car at the latter, where they find it weeping. Leela asks him if they can end his misery. However, Project Satan responds that he loves to run over people. Just then, Bender transforms and this time chooses to kill Fry. Project Satan tries to kill Leela only to run into a furnace, melting him and ending the curse. Fry, who was inside Bender at the time, is assumed dead but fitted perfectly in his chassis. They celebrate, causing Bender to strangle Fry for drinking his last beer.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Sal's Speech Impediment===\nSal's tendency to pluralize words unnecessarily hasn't yet gone over the top. He does it somewhat excessively in this episode but he gets much worse in later seasons.\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\nBender is run over and rather badly damaged by a werecar. Fry is trapped in Bender's driver's seat when Bender transforms back to his normal self for the last time, which momentarily appears to have resulted in Fry's death.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nOn leaving work for the evening, Fry and Leela part company with no sign of feelings for each other. However, it is interesting to consider her parting comment, which comes in the form of an expression of loneliness. It was just such an expression that led to a near-kiss on the Titanic. Perhaps Leela hopes it will happen again.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

[[Bender]], desperate to get the part, boos every applicant, as Calculon thinks there is an audience. When Bender comes up, [[Fry]] and [[Leela]]'s cheering get him the part.\nIn Bender's first scene, he is supposed to be put in an irreversible coma. He doesn't like the part and does his antics on camera, even going so far as to say his catchphrase &quot;Bite my shiny metal ass&quot;. Calculon only does one take so they can't reshoot.

Together, they go to the studio to demand that all TVs be equipped with a v-chip to censor Bender. But the network executive refuses to let him quit and both sides put a gun up to him. Bender distracts them and takes their guns.

Ooh, the Jedis are going to feel this one... |Farnsworth}}\n\n'''Crimes of the Hot''' is the sixty-second episode of ''[[Futurama]]'', guest starring the voice of [[Al Gore]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nAs Earth is unable to counter its rising temperature through its usual method (the dropping of a giant ice cube into the ocean), Gore leads an emergency conference in Kyoto, Japan, where Professor Farnsworth claims responsibility for the crisis. It seems love detoured him from observing proper emission standards on his prototype robot, and that could necessitate the destruction of all its &quot;descendants.&quot; That includes Bender, who resigns himself to having a farewell blowout before being blown up.\n\n== Plot ==\n===Act I===\nA heat wave is striking [[Earth]]. The [[Planet Express crew]] try to take a dip in the pool with instant water, but Nibbler drinks it all. He belches chlorine gas which knocks out the organics and rusts [[Bender]]. Wanting to learn more, they watch an old video on global warming which explains that the mid 21st century government simply dropped ice in the ocean, but over time it took bigger chunks. [[Richard M. Nixon]] sends the crew to gather ice from [[Halley's comet]] but it is empty.\n\nGlobal warming soon heats up the Earth so much that the ice caps have flooded. [[Randy]] created his own Noah's Ark, but his companion criticizes him for putting only same sex animals in it.\n\nAt the same time, Bender, noticing the turtles' migration to Holland, travels there to rescue one. He confides in his friends that he and the turtle share something: they can't get up if knocked on their backs.\n\nA [[robot]] hover truck announces that all scientists are called to [[Kyoto]] to discuss how to deal with the situation. The host, [[Al Gore (character)|Al Gore]], offers a bag of sapphires to the scientist who can solve the crisis, intriguing the dark wizard attending the conference. [[Wernstrom]] uses a giant mirror to reflect half of the sun's ray but a stray asteroid alters its angle and the ray incinerates everything in its path. When it's [[Farnsworth]]'s turn, he uses a memory ray to explain to everyone that the [[Sport-Utility Robot|robots]] that consume alcohol and burp pollution he built for [[Mom's Friendly Robot Company]] years ago were the problem. The scientists determine that to save the Earth, they need to destroy all robots.\n\nNixon gathers all the robots on the [[Galápagos Islands]] for a &quot;party&quot;, but despite the obviousness that it's a trap, Bender is willing to go. However, he accidentally lets slip that Nixon is going to destroy all robots, causing a panic. Nixon heads for space, meeting with Wernstrom, to prepare for the robots' destruction. Wernstrom had modified his mirror into an electromagnetic pulse array to permanently shut down all the robots. In return, Wernstrom is given the [[Headless Body of Spiro Agnew]]. Luckily, the Professor arrives to announce that he has come up with a plan to cool the Earth and save the robots at the same time. He instructs them all to vent their exhaust ports in the same direction, pushing the Earth further from the sun. However, Bender is knocked on his back and can't get up to help. Using his pet turtle's example, he gets up, lets out a huge exhaust and pushes the Earth out of the vicinity of the EMP device. Farnsworth is given the [[Polluting Medal of Pollution]] from Nixon. Now that there is an extra week on Earth, Nixon declares it &quot;[[Robot Party Week]]&quot;. But as they begin partying, the robots emit fumes that choke everyone else.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Injury, Dismemberment, Death===\n* The entire human crew is poisoned and Bender's body is corroded by a cloud of chlorine gas belched by Nibbler.\n* Countless Mr. Sunbeams are beaten to death by gangs of greenhouse gases.\n* Bender returns from Holland with wooden foot cups.\n* The entire crew work together to knock bender onto his back so they can mock him.\n* Wernstrom's sunshade-as-death-ray incinerates at least one person and possibly numerous others.\n* In flashback, C-3PO is crushed to death by Farnsworth's machine press.\n* In flashback, Mom repeatedly bangs Farnsworth's head on her desk and slaps him around.\n* Crushinator dances very roughly with Bender, against his will.\n* Many robots are injured in the panic and prolonged fistfight that follow the news of Nixon's plan to destroy them all.\n* The entire human crew is poisoned again at the end of the episode, but this time by the exhaust from all the robots at the party.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* Bender serves as the company film projector.\n* Al Gore is introduced as the inventor of the environment.\n* Rather than allow Bender to attend Nixon's extermination &quot;party&quot;, Fry suggests that they put bananas on top of Bender and tell everyone that he is a bowl.\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

Bender was made Pharaoh on the planet [[O'Cyris IV|Osiris IV]], but his servants, fed up with inhumane treatment, sent him to his grave (before he actually died).\n\nBender also is fascinated with cooking, though he is shown to have no sense of actual human taste, often creating dishes that can kill plant life. He also thinks that humans eat rocks. Magnets, when attached to his head, cause him to lose his sense of inhibition and act like a folk singer.\n\n==Before Planet Express==\n\nBender was built in the year 2996 in Tijuana, Mexico. Bender was built without a backup unit, which is meant to help him backup data so that if his body was destroyed he could upload his data into another body if he wants. Without this unit, Bender was recognized as defective and therefore not to tarnish [[MomCorp|Mom's Company]] he would need to be destroyed. However, Hermes (who worked at Mom's Robot Company as a bureaucrat back then) was in charge of destroying defective robots and chose not to kill Bender. He authorized Bender's approval and Bender left the factory defective and mortal. As a bending unit, he spent his life before he met [[Fry]] bending girders to be used for [[suicide booth]]s. After learning this, he tried to kill himself, but was unsuccessful. He gave up on that when Fry claimed that he was his only friend in the future. Along with [[Leela]] and Fry, he joined Planet Express as a crew member.\n\n== Age(s) ==\nAlthough Bender's body was made in [[2996]], his head is an additional 1055 years old because it was buried in the ground for years after traveling back in time.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Roswell That Ends Well]]&quot;&gt;''[[Roswell that Ends Well]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He has also traveled back in time and waited until the present day many times with the Time Sphere, adding millions of years onto his age.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Bender's Big Score]]&quot; /&gt; Also, with the addition of the forward time machine, he has witnessed the end of the universe twice. Travelling in the time machine meant Bender's experience was relative, and aged no more than the standard time experienced within the time machine. the universe at present is estimated to be 13.7 billion (13,700,000,000) years of age, and the time until the estimated &quot;end&quot; or &quot;death&quot; of the universe is 10^150 (far too large to write without powers). Assuming the new Big Bangs occurred the moment the previous iteration of the universe died and that scientific estimates of the past and future are correct, Bender has existed (but only partially aged) for 27,400,000,000 + 2*10^150 + some odd thousands and hundreds of years. Because of these trips back in time, Bender's exact age is unknown but he is one of the oldest of the Planet Crew along with Professor Farnsworth and Fry.\n\n== Personality Traits ==\nBender is a selfish and insensitive robot who usually cares about no one except himself. He has been known for getting the Planet Express Crew into a lot of trouble due to his scheming, yet rarely shows any signs of remorse. Bender has no problem committing most crimes, and will gladly do so, ranging from the petty theft of wallets to more serious crimes like kidnapping [[Jay Leno's head]] due to their long feud.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television]]&quot;&gt;''[[Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he also does not have one slight grain of sympathy for anyone on Earth, with two exceptions: Turtles, because he identifies with them, and Fry, whom he considers to be his best friend; at Fry's &quot;funeral,&quot; he even admitted that whenever he said &quot;Kill all humans,&quot; he would quietly amend it with &quot;Except one.&quot;\n\nThough usually rude and selfish, Bender does have a rarely seen soft side. More than once he has saved Fry's life. He was genuinely hurt when Fry kicked him out of their apartment because he was interfering with the TV. He once saved the world from a evil sun flame and no one but Fry knew. He supported Fry's playing of the Holophonor, going so far as to attended one of Fry's concerts. He even shed a tear when Fry told him he was going to propose to Leela, saying &quot;He's all grown up&quot;.\n\nIn general, though, Bender's behavior is defined by a rude and brash nature as well as excessive use of foul language. He also has many vices: He smokes (because it make him look cool), has done electricity (jacking on), and has had many romantic and sexual relations with woman who are usually robots like him. He also drinks heavily; technically, though, this is not a vice, as alcohol fuels his power cells--if he was not a robot his behavior would be classified as 'alcoholic' but he needs alcohol to stay sober, and has on occasion been known to not-drink to excess and become 'drunk.' Bender is also a kleptomaniac, and can often be seen looting and thieving from his friends and co-workers, especially Amy, who is Bender's favorite thieving victim because she and her parents are rich. He is also an accomplished con artist, having gained [[Fry]]'s power of attorney.\n\nBender is a strong proponent for robots obtaining human rights, and gets very upset when he hears people claiming that human life is more important than robot life. When he is sufficiently frightened or sickened, bricks have been seen to fall from his backside on at least one occasion (a reference to the line &quot;shitting bricks.&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot;&gt;''[[Space Pilot 3000]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He has also shown the qualities of an avid shutterbug: When he is sufficiently fascinated by something, he may pull out a camera and snap a picture, claiming that the event is &quot;neat.&quot;\n\n== Talents ==\nBending and stealing. He also practices (stage) magic and can speak penguin and Space Bee. Having a robot body, he is also much more durable than a human.\n\nBender's chest cavity could be considered a magic satchel, as it has been show to be able to hold a whole human, inhuman torch; at least two heads; cigars and even the riches of an entire kingdom,a byclops built for two.\n \nIn &quot;[[Insane in the Mainframe]]&quot;, Bender speaks French (considered a dead language in the 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century) while pretending to think of himself as Napoleon, also greeting the crew by saying &quot;''bonjour''&quot;, meaning &quot;hello.&quot;\n\nHe can sing, as shown in &quot;[[Bendin' in the Wind]]&quot;.\n\nBender has a love for cooking. However, because he has no sense of taste, his food comes out terrible. As the series progressed, it seems his cooking skills have improved a bit. He managed to make a cake for Nibbler and manage to create an edible salad.\n\nBender is also very good at tap dancing as shown in the episode Stench and Stenchibility, where he comes in second place in a tap dance contest.\n\n== Death ==\nWhen the [[Planet Express crew]] threw Bender a fake funeral to prove they would remember him when he died, Fry said that Bender's favorite way to die would be none other than being crushed by a runaway semi truck driven by the Incredible Hulk; Bender was touched that Fry remembered that fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[A Pharaoh to Remember]]&quot;&gt;''[[A Pharaoh to Remember]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAdditionally, Bender's retirement plan is to turn his &quot;on-off&quot; switch to &quot;off.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Insane in the Mainframe]]&quot;&gt;''[[Insane in the Mainframe]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn Bender's Big Score, several paradox Benders died by explosion and one by destruction code from bladder failure.\n\nIn Lethal Inspection, it was revealed that all robots have a wireless back-up unit that will download them into a new body if their current body is destroyed. However, Bender did not have a back-up unit due to [[Hermes Conrad|Inspector #5]] overriding a quality control failure on Bender, so when his hard drive is destroyed he will die.\n\nIn Ghosts in the Machines, Bender is murdered by his ex-girlfriend (a suicide booth named Lynn) and becomes a robot ghost in limbo. He is returned back to his normal self at the end of the episode by saving Fry's life and redeeming himself.\n\nIn Where No Fan Has Gone Before, George Takei said a destruct sequence that made Bender blow up. Technically he didn't die, but he did explode. The sequence was 1A 2B 3C...\n\n== Family ==\n[[File:Bender's mum.png|thumb|200px|A picture of Bender's mother.]]\n*Professor [[Farnsworth]], owner/creator of the [[Sport-Utility Robot]] on which Bender and all other modern robots are based.\n*Bender's grandmother, probably on his mother's side, is a bulldozer. Leela says, &quot;Come on, Bender, your grandmother could push harder than that!&quot; and Bender says, &quot;No crap! My grandmother was a bulldozer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*[[Mom]], owner of ''Mom's Friendly Robot Co.''.\n*[[Bender's mother|His mother]], a robotic arm who sends him [[Xmas]] cards.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Mother's Day]]&quot;&gt;''[[Mother's Day]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*[[Bender's father|His father]], who was killed by a giant can opener.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[I Second that Emotion]]&quot;&gt;''[[I Second that Emotion]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Buster, Bender's identical cousin.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]&quot; /&gt;\n*Uncle [[Vladimir]] on father's side, who lived in [[Thermostadt]], capital of the Robo-Hungarian Empire, and died at the ripe old age of 211.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Honking]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Honking]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*[[Tandy]], Uncle Vladimir's son and hence Bender's cousin.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Honking]]&quot; /&gt;\n*Screwy Aunt Rita, who is a screw.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Sting]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Sting]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*[[Bender's firstborn son]]; given to the [[Robot Devil]] in exchange for an [[Army of the Damned]].&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]&quot; /&gt;\n*[[Flexo]], another Bending unit of the same model.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Lesser of Two Evils]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Lesser of Two Evils]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Turner, Bender's cousin mentioned in That Darn Katz.\n*[[Hermes Conrad]] (Inspector #5) who approved a newly constructed Bender even though he had no Backup unit.

However he doesn't seem to have much interest in a monogamous or long-term relationship. Some of his relationships have come to very abrupt ends, but Bender never seems to mourn for long.\n*[[Crushinator]] - is seen being chased away from the moon farm by the human father for making out with his robot daughter. She later refuses to pursue Bender claiming to love him.\n*[[Countess de la Roca]] - a rich fembot who he meets on the Titanic. He is left devastated when she dies after being sucked into a black hole.\n*[[Femputer]] - a Fembot posing as a giant computer after which Bender discovers her secret he makes out with her and then avoids her calls.\n*[[Angleyne]] - a divorced fembot who originally dates Bender but falls back in love with her ex husband Flexo after going on a date with Bender posing as Flexo.\n*[[Lucy Liu's head]] - Bender and Lucy meet when the planet express crew rescue her when prompted by Fry Lucy says she is in love with Bender who makes room for her in his chest compartment.\n*[[Planet Express ship]] - he dates the ship when she gets a new personality but she becomes deranged and hostile when he dumps her.\n*[[Calculon]] - when Bender gets a sex change into olympic medal winner Coilette (s)he dates and almost marries Calculon intending to scam him out of half his fortune but cannot when he no longer wishes to hurt him.\n*[[Lynn]] - a [[suicide booth]] ex-girlfriend who killed Bender.\n*[[Fanny]] - Donbot's wife that Bender has an affair with and plans to run away with her but once found out he loses interest and Fanny goes back to the Donbot.\n*[[Amy Wong]] - they begin an illegal robosexual romance as Amy has an interest in bad boys but when robosexual marriage becomes legal Bender dumps her (as he doesn't want a monogamous relationship).\n*[[Bella]] - Fanny and Donbot's daughter. When crashing a mob wedding Bender meets Bella and they end up making out in the Donbots stable, afterwards Bender shows no interest in her and she becomes clingy. She later shoots an innocent hilbilly; Billy West, who resembles Bender.\n*[[Bev]] - Planet Express's soda machine. Bender got her pregnant and she gave birth to his son [[Ben Rodríguez|Ben]].\n\n== Bugs, Viruses and Programming Errors ==\nOver the years, Bender has had many bugs, viruses and errors. He once had his personality removed (causing him to say nothing other than &quot;I am Bender, please insert girder&quot; in a monotone voice).&lt;ref name=&quot;[[How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back]]&quot;&gt;''[[How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Bender was run over by, and turned into a [[were-car]] at one point.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Honking]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Honking]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He downloaded the ''iObey'' virus to make him do what the [[Nudist Alien Scammers|makers of the virus]] want.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Bender's Big Score]]&quot; /&gt;\n\nBender also has a self-destruct code, 1A2B3C (but before C he explodes), that causes his head to blow up.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]&quot;&gt;''[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMagnets placed on Bender's head cause his inhibition unit to malfunction thus making him sing Folk songs.\n\nBender has no Backup Unit to make him technically mortal as a robot, but he was approved anyway.\n\nBender almost turned into one with the planet express crew ship, making him say he was &quot;a cuddly baby tapir&quot;.\n\n== Catchphrases ==\nBender has a few catchphrases, such as [[Bite my Shiny Metal Ass]]. Bender also frequently uses the word meat-bag, and utters the phrase &quot;Kill all humans&quot; often, even if he always silently adds &quot;except one&quot; referring to Fry.\n\nIn the &quot;War is the H-word&quot; episode Bender's Top Ten Most Frequently Uttered Words is listed as:\n\n1. Ass&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Daffodil&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Shiny&lt;br /&gt;\n4. My&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Bite&lt;br /&gt;\n6. Pimpmobile&lt;br /&gt;\n7. Up&lt;br /&gt;\n8. Yours&lt;br /&gt;\n9. Chumpette&lt;br /&gt;\n10. Chump\n\nIn addition Bender's least frequently used word according to the same episode is &quot;antiquing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;[[War is the H-Word]]&quot;&gt;''[[War is the H-Word]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBender also has a tendency to say &quot;Neat&quot; whenever he is intrigued by something.\n\nBender will say (or sometimes sing) &quot;Let's go already!&quot; on many occasions and when coming back from an adventure, he will often exclaim &quot;I'm back baby&quot;.\n\nBender often says, &quot;it's gonna be fun on the bun.&quot;\n\nBender often says, &quot;Shut up baby, I know it.&quot;\n\nBender often says: &quot;Me, (short pause) Bender&quot;\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:I'm 40% Bender|thumb|right|400px]]\nIron-Osmium Alloy\n*40% Zinc &lt;ref name=&quot;[[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory]]&quot;&gt;''[[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*40% Titanium &lt;ref name=&quot;[[A Head in the Polls]]&quot;&gt;''[[A Head in the Polls]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*40% Dolomite &lt;ref name=&quot;[[Jurassic Bark]]&quot;&gt;''[[Jurassic Bark]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*40% Luck (from horseshoes) &lt;ref name=&quot;[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]&quot;&gt;''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*40% Chromium &lt;ref name=&quot;[[Attack of the Killer App]]&quot;&gt;''[[Attack of the Killer App]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*40% Wires &lt;ref name=&quot;[[Decision 3012]]&quot;&gt;''[[Decision 3012]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*40% Scrap Metal &lt;ref name=&quot;[[All the Presidents' Heads]]&quot;&gt;''[[All the Presidents' Heads]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n*30% Iron\n*±0.04% Nickel impurity\n* 40% empty &lt;ref name=&quot;[[Free Will Hunting]]&quot;&gt;''[[Free Will Hunting]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n* 60% storage space\n* 40% Platinum\n*Unknown amount of Osmium\n\nNot counting luck (since it is derived from the iron he is made from, which is recycled from horseshoes), Bender is made up of 170.04% more material than should be possible (a total of 270.04%) however Dolomite is a mineral so it is possible that the Dolomite only held the elements that later created Bender. Also Bender's body has been repaired/replaced many times. It is also notable that most robots contain a &quot;Back up drive&quot; in their composition, Bender does not.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Episodes ===\n* &quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot;\n* most if not all episodes \n\n=== Films ===\n* &quot;[[Bender's Big Score]]&quot;\n\n=== Games ===\n* &quot;[[Futurama: The Game]]&quot; (Character)\n* &quot;[[Futurama Genetics Lab|Genetics Lab]]&quot; (Test Subject)\n\n== Trivia ==\n*One of Bender's hobbies is photography, having often been seen taking pictures while saying &quot;Neat.&quot;\n*Bender often disdains singing; this may be related to his court-ordered ban on singing.\n*Bender's e-mail is bender@ilovebender.com as revealed in ''[[Bender's Big Score]].''\n*Bender once owned a guinea pig, as mentioned in the episode &quot;[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela]]&quot;.\n*During the episode &quot;[[Overclockwise]]&quot;, it's not only revealed that Bender has an X-Cube account, but also that his gamertag is BenderIsGreat34.\n*His vanity plate reads “1 DVS BSTD” (one devious bastard).\n* Bender has hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia - fear of the number 666.\n* Bender has named his hands &quot;Grabby and Squeezy&quot;, and his footcups &quot;Stompy and Smashy&quot;.\n* In Firefox, if you type &quot;about:robots&quot; into the address bar, a page with several cultural references to robots is displayed. The fourth bullet point says &quot;Robots have shiny metal posteriors which should not be bitten.&quot;, a reference to Bender's famous saying, &quot;Bite my shiny metal ass!&quot;.\n* Bender's height is revealed in the episode &quot;[[The Cyber House Rules]]&quot; when he shows a picture of himself in a police line up to the orphan children. Bender (according to the photo he showed) is about 5'8&quot;, with a total 6'2&quot; if you include his antenna.\n*Bender weighs 525 pounds. However in ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'', he says &quot;all two tons of me&quot;.\n** In addition, Leela states that his and [[Countess De La Roca|Countess De La Roca's]] combined weight is two metric tons (roughly 4410 lbs) in ''[[A Flight to Remember]]''. Averaged between him and Countess it comes out as a metric ton a piece, or roughly 2205 lbs.\n*He has been charged for pimping, theft, vandalism and many others. It may, in fact, be easier to list the crimes he has NOT committed.\n*Bender briefly broke the fourth wall during ''Into the Wild Green Yonder'', after hearing that he is having an affair with the Donbot's wife, his co-workers ask if he's crazy, to which he says &quot;No, Fry's crazy in this one&quot;, referencing that he went mad in the previous movie.\n*Bender's apartment number is &lt;nowiki&gt;00100&lt;/nowiki&gt;100 001&lt;nowiki&gt;00100&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- Leave this in to prevent the wiki from inserting a &quot;tel&quot; formatting command --&gt;. This is a binary representation of the ASCII character '$'.\n*Alternatively, same number read in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Little-endian little-endian] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal BCD] translates to 42, famous Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, and ASCII symbol for B, Bender's initial.\n*Bender's serial number is 2716057. This can be expressed as the sum of 2 cubes. Specifically, 952&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + (-951)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;\n*The word &quot;bender&quot; can refer to a drinking spree, hinting at Bender's heavy alcohol use.\n*Bender is powered by a 6502 Microprocessor (although in &quot;Overclockwise&quot;, he is seen with an AMD Athlon in his ass).\n*Bender dies at the end of both of his what-if scenarios in each Anthology of Interest and both have one of the characters saying &quot;Goodnight, sweet prince&quot; (Fry in the first and Farnsworth in the second) to Bender when he dies.\n*His self-destruct code is 1A2B3...C is not said before he explodes therefore the code does not include C.\n*Bender cannot have magnets attached to his head, or it will &quot;screw up his inhibition unit&quot;, thus causing him to sing crazy variations of folk songs.\n*It seems his birthstone is [[Robobium]], as mentioned in the Game.\n*He is able to simultaneously reattach each of his severed arms with the other.\n*Until he learned how from the majestic turtle, Bender could not get up when knocked on his back.\n*His antenna interferes with satellite television, along with some cellphones.\n*He, along with [[Fry]] and [[Leela]], appears in all episodes of the series.\n*No one can say he doesn't own John Laroquette's Spine.\n*Bender may be one of the most evil robots in the series, as acknowledged by [[Robot Santa]] and the [[Robot Devil]].\n*Bender's favorite cause of death is being crushed to death by a &quot;runaway semi driven by The Incredible Hulk.&quot;.\n*He said the last full sentence in all 4 films - &quot;Well, we're boned!&quot; (''Bender's Big Score''), &quot;I love you, meatbags!&quot; (''The Beast with a Billion Backs''), &quot;Whip harder, Professor!&quot; (''Benders Game''), &quot;Into the breach, meatbags. Or not, whatever.&quot; (''Into the Wild Green Yonder''). It is worth noting, however, that it was Farnsworth who voiced the last words in the film ''Bender's Game'', and not Bender. (&quot;Faster! Faster! Slower!&quot;)\n*When Bender's personality is removed he continuously repeats the sentence, &quot;I am Bender, please insert girder.&quot;\n*Through court order, Bender is prohibited from singing. (It should be noted that the only time Bender says this is so is in Leela's coma dream in &quot;[[The Sting]]&quot;, though it's possible it's something Leela remembered that the real Bender had said, like many of the other things in her coma dream)\n*Bender is a convicted felon and has the longest rap sheet of anyone alive. (''Into the Wild Green Yonder'')\n*Through imitating a fembot, he holds five gold medals in the Earth Olympics.\n*According to an x-mas story, Bender's mom is a mechanical arm, however, throughout the rest of the series Bender claims his mom is Mom the Oil tycoon. This could, however, just reference the fact that Mom is considered the mother of all modern robots and thus his true mother is the arm. Also, Bender once said, &quot;No crap, my grandmother was a bulldozer&quot;.\n*The 40% luck that Bender is made of really paid off in ''Bender's Big Score'' because as stated by Nibbler, everytime the paradox time orb is used, there's a chance the universe could be ripped apart. This said, Bender would have to be very lucky since he used the orb countless times without the universe's destruction.\n*Bender has been his fem-bot alter ego &quot;Coilette&quot; twice. First being &quot;[[Bend Her]]&quot; the second being &quot;[[Neutopia]]&quot;.\n*Bender's history with Planet Express is murky; in &quot;Overclockwise&quot;, the Professor has a flashback turning Bender on for the first time and ignoring the EULA. In another episode, Hermes states &quot;Bender is Planet Expresses' most expensive piece of equipment&quot;. Furthermore, in &quot;[[Free Will Hunting]]&quot;, along with several other episodes, it's infererred the Professor built or designed Bender himself (though in other episodes Bender was born in the factory). However, in the series premiere, it seems Bender has never even been to Planet Express, and starts working at the company the same day as Fry and Leela.\n*Bender has made 2 apperances in ''Family Guy'', the first in the cantina scene in ''Blue Harvest'', and the second he was telling the gang where the dirty joke came from.\n*A comment by Bender while being initiated into the League of Robots in ''The Beast With A Billion Backs'' implies that he has attended med school.\n*Due to the events in &quot;Free Will Hunting&quot; Bender now possesses the only existing robotic Free Will Unit.

Fry II: Astronaut, philanthropist, entrepreneur; was a great man truly worthy of narration. Fry was the first man on Mars... a feat that has never since been equaled.|Anonymous film narrator|The Luck of the Fryish}}\n\n'''Philip Joe Fry II''' (born April 21, 2003 - May 8, 2100) was the first man on [[Mars]], also known for his fantastical good fortune. He is [[Fry]]'s nephew. \n\nHis fantastic good fortune is accredited to his possession of a [[seven leaf clover]]. While the clover was originally found by his [[Philip J. Fry|uncle]], it was given to him by his father, [[Yancy Fry]], after he discovered it in Fry's copy of ''The Breakfast Club Soundtrack'' while looking for music to clear out the reception hall after his wedding.\n\n== History ==\nAt a young age he made his fortune after striking oil in the bathroom of the mansion he had won in a lottery. After a &quot;whirlwind fling&quot; with Icelandic supermodel, Njörd, his band Leaf Seven had scored a string of top-ten hits, who were known for their &quot;hypnotic rhythms, driving baselines, and memorable hooks&quot;. He was the first man on Mars, Amy's home planet. The reason he is so lucky and famous is that his father, Yancy Fry Jr., named him after his uncle and presented him with Fry's lucky clover. When Fry learned the true secret to his history he didn't want to take the clover from his grave anymore.\n\n== In ''Bender's Big Score'' ==\nIn ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'', he makes an appearance as young boy who tells Bender that Philip J. Fry I went to the North Pole. Rather than actually directing Bender to Fry (who was currently frozen in the cryogenic tube), Philip J. Fry II pointed Bender in the direction of the Paradox-duplicate of Fry, who would later take up the identity of [[Lars]]. He looks something like his uncle, and has a similar attitude to him (repeatedly insulting Bender, however this ceased after he took out a rather large Ray-Gun) His grave was shown as Fry attempted to retrieve his lucky clover but the body was never shown leading some fans to speculate if his head had been preserved. It is unlikely but not impossible as famous people tend to add &quot;'s head&quot; to their name once they are preserved in this manner which could explain the grave.\n\n==Family Tree==\n\n Mr. Gleisner──┬──Mrs. Gleisner     [[Philip J.

That makes me feel angry!|Robot Devil}}\n\n'''The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings''' is the [[:Category:Season Four|Season 4]] finale of ''Futurama'', and was the final episode broadcasted on [[wikipedia:Fox_Broadcasting_Company|Fox]]. It aired originally on August 10, 2003. The episode coincidentally became the last episode aired on Adult Swim on December 31, 2007 when the series' contract with the network expired. It was originally intended to be the final episode produced for the series. It was written by [[Ken Keeler]], who was nominated for an Emmy in 2004 for Outstanding Music and Lyrics.\n\nStruggling to play the holophonor because of his hands, Fry is convinced to make a deal with the Robot Devil to swap hands with an automaton, thinking that he will get hands that would play the instrument better. After the Robot Devil randomly himself being selected, they swap hands and Fry enjoys success as his new and superior hands can play perfectly. Bitter with Fry's hands, the Robot Devil comes up with tactics to have him regain his hands back during Fry's career as a professional holophoner.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter a disappointing [[holophonor]] recital, [[Fry]] enlists the help of the [[Robot Devil]] to improve his holophonor skills through hand transplants. After randomly determining the robot “donor” by spinning a wheel (which contains all of the robots featured in the series), Fry’s hands are switched for those of the Robot Devil himself. Fry then becomes a skilled holophonor player, performing at [[Hovercar-negie Hall]], and attempts to win the heart of [[Leela]] through an opera commissioned by [[Hedonismbot]].\n\nThe Robot Devil, who is unhappy with the trade because Fry's hands are &quot;always touching [him] in places&quot;, decides he must win his own hands back. He gives [[Bender]] a stadium air horn, so that he can annoy people. When Bender uses the air horn on Leela, she becomes deaf. Robot Devil then taunts Bender, because Bender traded away his &quot;Shiny Metal Ass&quot; for the air horn, so now Robot Devil can't bite it. Afraid Fry would stop composing the opera, if he knew she couldn't hear, she attends the opera, pretending to still be able to hear the performance. Fry's opera, [[Leela: Orphan of the Stars]], opens in the [[Metropolitan House of Opera]]. During the intermission, the Robot Devil offers Leela robotic ears in exchange for her hand. Leela, who is thrilled she will hear the end of Fry’s opera, agrees.\n\nThe Robot Devil interrupts the opera when Fry portrays him as an idiot. He demands that Fry return his hands. When Fry refuses, the Robot Devil says that he will take Leela’s hand… in marriage. A dramatic opera is sung until Fry trades the Robot Devil’s hands back for his own.\n\nWith his own hands, Fry can no longer play the holophonor well and the remainder of the opera is terrible. Everyone in the audience leaves, except for Leela, who asks that he continue playing, as she wanted to “hear how it ends.” The finale of Fry’s opera shows a very crudely-animated Fry and Leela kissing, then walking into the distance hand-in-hand.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry practices the holophonor in the hopes of making Leela like him. Never having indicated musical inclination before (except briefly in [[Parasites Lost]]), he says that he hears great music in his head. Leela, never having indicated musical appreciation before (except briefly in Parasites Lost), tells the story of Sean, a loser whom she loved primarily because of his musical talent. The stage is set for an exploration of the relationship between Fry and Leela.\n\nWhen he first receives the Robot Devil's hands, Fry exclaims, &quot;At last, I'll have the power to make Leela love me!&quot; While it's clear where Fry stands, Leela is harder to read. While attending a large performance by Fry, Leela sheds tears, but we don't know which kind of love they might indicate. She and Fry have become close friends over the years, but she has only briefly shown flickers of interest in him. When Fry announces that he will make his opera about her, she plays very coy, pretending to be surprised.\n\nEverything changes when Leela hears Fry's music, when she shows that she is the same woman who dated Sean: she immediately falls for Fry and gushes about his enormous creativity. In his opera, Fry describes Leela as &quot;the woman that I idolize.&quot; The opera itself is a glorious example of this sentiment, but for now, it's the best Fry can do, and for now, it seems to be enough for Leela. After all the other opera patrons abandon the theater, Leela asks Fry to show her the ending, even if necessarily performed by his human hands.\n\nIt seems that Fry and Leela might be at the threshold of a new phase in their relationship.\n\n===Injury, Torture, Dismemberment===\n* The mother of the talented holophonor player at Fry's recital reports hitting the child &quot;fairly hard&quot;.\n* Fry is attacked by an angry recital audience, who throw wadded up sheet music at him. Later, while performing his magnum opus, he is similarly attacked by patrons at the opera house.\n* Fry and Bender visit the Robot Devil in Robot Hell, where countless dead robots are being tortured.\n* Fry and the Robot Devil trade hands, and ultimately trade back.\n* The Robot Devil's hands, although attached to Fry's wrists, attempt to strangle Fry.\n* Using his new hands, Fry disassembles Bender, juggles his individual parts for a moment, and reassembles him.\n* The female aristocrat in Fry's practice tune is knocked off-screen by a Donkey-Kong-style barrel.\n* In exchange for having a boat horn affixed to his face, Bender gives the Robot Devil his &quot;crotch plate&quot; (which Bender refers to as &quot;my ass&quot; in [[Roswell That Ends Well]]).\n* Leela is permanently deafened by Bender's new boat horn.\n* The Robot Devil removes Calculon's ears and attaches them to Leela.\n* The Robot Devil kicks an actor off the stage into the orchestra pit.\n* After Fry shoves the Robot Devil away from Leela, the Robot Preacher is knocked off the stage and can be heard crashing into things off-screen.\n\n===Character Arcs===\nBender seems to have taken an interest in literature. He chides the Robot Devil three times about his misuse of the word ''irony''. First, the fact that the wheel chose the Robot Devil is, as Bender says, &quot;coincidence&quot;, not irony. Second, the fact that Leela's deafness defeats the purpose of Fry having the Robot Devil's hands is, as Bender says, &quot;just mean&quot;, not irony. Third, the Robot Devil reveals that when he asked for Leela's hand, he meant her hand ''in marriage''. Bender points out that this is irony as defined in the dictionary.\n\nWhen Bender attempts to blast the Robot Devil with his boat horn, he finds himself out of aerosol. The Robot Devil mocks Bender, saying, &quot;Also ironic.&quot; This is unfortunate coincidence, not irony, but Bender doesn't mention it.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* Fry's holophonor opera features actors portraying the Orphanarium headmaster, Bender, Fry, Leela, and the Robot Devil.\n* Midway through Fry's opera, he stops playing his instrument--shutting down the simulation--and the actual characters continue the opera simultaneously with &quot;real life&quot;.\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

At the visitor lodge, [[Ranger Park]], the park ranger, says he is obsessed with [[Bigfoot]] and hopes to obtain proof of his existence. He shows a video which says that due to over-logging, Bigfoot habitats have become scarce. During the night, [[Bender]], annoyed with bugs, tricks [[Fry]] into leaving his tent so Bender can take it. In a clearing, Fry is abducted by [[alien]]s. When he returns, he finds that his nose is no longer on his face and that human noses are often used by aliens as an [[Wikipedia:Aphrodisiac|aphrodisiac]] known as &quot;[[Human horn]].&quot;\n\nAfter searching the [[Galactic Bazaar]], Fry, along with [[Leela]] and Bender, traces his nose to [[Lrrr]] who purchased it to help his failing marriage with [[Ndnd]]. He gets his nose back, only to have Bender ask Lrrr why noses, and not the genitals, are used as the aphrodisiac. Lrrr is intrigued by this and orders Fry's &quot;[[Wikipedia:Penis|lower horn]]&quot; to be removed. Leela, however, manages to make a deal that if the crew can help Lrrr's marriage by giving him and [[Ndnd]] a romantic dinner without using the &quot;lower horn&quot;, Fry will be spared.\n\nThe plan fails as a result of a boring dinner and of Leela's singing, which the Omicronians consider an attack, and Lrrr orders Fry's lower horn removed, Bigfoot interrupts them, closely pursued by Parks, who plans on cutting off his leg to prove his existence. Lrrr saves the Sasquatch, but Parks manages to get a piece of fur. Lrrr almost proceeds to finishing removing Fry's lower horn but soon realizes that he'd be no better than Parks. Ndnd, realizing that he is the sensitive [[Omicronian]] she fell for long ago, is in love with Lrrr again. They start making out and advise the others to get 500 hundred meters away as the trio go running for their lives.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Lrrr and Ndnd===\nThe marital problems of Lrrr and Ndnd don't end here. Years later, the couple end up temporarily separating in [[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]], and Lrrr very nearly has a one-night stand.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* Bender converts himself into a hammock.\n* Bender serves as a bug-zapper for the campers.\n* Bender impersonates Bigfoot to lure Fry out of his tent.\n* Bender serves as a mirror so Fry can see that his nose really is missing.\n* Leela's Wrist LoJack-a-mater serves as an emergency face-laser.\n* A styrofoam ice chest serves, as Bender puts it, as &quot;a handy wang coffin&quot;.\n\n===Character Arcs===\n* Sal has taken a turn for the worse. Until now his disorder resulted only in the letter &quot;s&quot; being appended to random words. In the advanced stages, as demonstrated here, the pluralization rules for irregular nouns appear, as when Sal says &quot;bigfeet&quot; rather than &quot;bigfoots&quot;.\n* Farnsworth mispronounces &quot;well&quot; as &quot;whell&quot;, but just afterward correctly pronounces &quot;why&quot;.\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nNot only do Hermes and Zoidberg share a tent, Zoidberg indicates to Bender that the two plan to engage in some &quot;just friends&quot; spooning. Perhaps latent homosexuality would explain the bizarre relationship between these two. Hermes can be shockingly cruel to Zoidberg, and then shockingly friendly. Perhaps Hermes is secretly in love with Zoidberg.\n\n===Death, Dismemberment, Injury===\n* Bender serves as a bug-zapper for the campers.\n* Disembodied noses are a central theme throughout the episode, and are believed by the Omicronians to be aphrodisiacs.\n* Leela punches the sleaze-shopkeeper in the gut.\n* Leela burns Fry's face with her emergency face-laser.\n* Fry tumbles down a hill in a burning cage, finally crashing into a tree. He emerges from the cave still burning.\n* No human lower horns are harmed.\n\n===The Scary Door===\nThe episode closes with a ''Scary Door'' episode in which the mad scientist creates the most evil creature in the world only to discover that his creation is man.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

Fry''', better known as '''Fry''', (born August 14, 1974) was a native to the 20th century who was cryogenically frozen seconds into the year 2000, having fallen in just as 1999 ended. He was revived in [[2999]], and subsequently became a delivery boy for the [[Planet Express]] Company. He is the main protagonist and character of ''[[Futurama]]''.\n\n==Personality==\nFry is generally very lazy at work, spending most of his time in the office sitting on the couch, watching TV, and drinking [[Slurm]]. This laziness has caused him to miss at least one delivery mission. He is often immature, which causes him to get into tight spots, usually forcing [[Leela]] to rescue him. Despite this, he is a good, sensitive and sentimental man who loves his friends, and will usually go to any lengths to save them.\n\n==Abilities==\nFry is &quot;special&quot;. He is immune to all psychic forms of attack, such as from [[Brain Slug]]s as well as the [[Brainspawn]]. Usually, this is passed off as a 'Fry is stupid' joke, but it is actually because he lacks the [[Delta Brainwave]]. This is because he is his own grandfather, meaning his very existence is a space-time anomaly.\n\nIf this was a genetic defect, [[Yancy Fry, Sr.|Yancy Sr.]], [[Yancy Fry|Yancy Jr.]], [[Philip J. Fry II]], [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]], [[Cubert]], and [[Igner]] (and many unnamed others) should have inherited this immunity, but it was caused because Fry is his own grandfather, and they are not directly their own ancestors; they are Fry's double-ancestors. This means that while they are all anomalies, their existence is not additionally cyclical like Fry's.\n\nSince ''[[The Late Philip J. Fry]],'' Fry is now even more of an anomaly than before; initially his existence in the universe was cyclical, but now he is also living in a universe he was not even born into. It is unknown how this may manifest in the future, but this means that as a time-travelling out-of-universe observer, he should theoretically no longer be subject to alterations in the current universe's Time Stream because of further time travel.\n\nSince they travelled with him in ''The Late Philip J. Fry'', [[Bender]] and Professor Farnsworth are also out-of-universe observers.\n\n==Life in the 20th century==\n{{Quote|Here's to another lousy millennium.|Philip J. Fry in ''[[Space Pilot 3000]]''}}\nFry was born on August 9, 1974&lt;ref name=&quot;FuturamaTimeline&quot;&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1690915 Futurama Timeline at Everything2]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Brooklyn]], [[Old New York|New York]] to Yancy Fry, Sr. and his mother, [[Mrs. Fry|née Gleisner]]. These surnames imply English and German ancestry. He was named Philip after the Philip's head screwdriver.\n\nWhen he was young, he dreamed of being an astronaut, but due to motion sickness and the fact nobody liked spending a week with him, his dream was never fulfilled. He would often play basketball with his older brother, Yancy, as well as participate in break-dancing competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Luck of the Fryish]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Luck of the Fryish]]''&lt;/ref&gt; When he was in high school, he drank nearly a hundred cans of cola per week, resulting in three heart attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory]]&quot;&gt;''[[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He also loved playing video games as he played them every day except the day that his eyes bled.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Anthology of Interest I]]&quot;&gt;''[[Anthology of Interest I]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He attended and subsequently dropped out of [[Coney Island Community College]], which in the standards of 31st century education, made him the equivalent of a high school drop out.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Mars University]]&quot;&gt;''[[Mars University]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBefore being frozen, Fry worked as a delivery boy at [[Panucci's Pizza]] in [[Manhattan]]. During this time, he delivered pizza to [[Fox Network]], and subsequently spilled beer on the control console, knocking Fox off the air.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[When Aliens Attack]]&quot;&gt;''[[When Aliens Attack]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He also discovered his pet dog, [[Seymour]] when someone prank called the pizzeria as Seymour Asses. Seymour and Fry would become very close and would often sing/bark “Walking on Sunshine” together.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Jurassic Bark]]&quot;&gt;''[[Jurassic Bark]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Fry was sent out to deliver a pizza to an [[I.C. Weiner]], an alias that [[Nibbler]] made up, at [[Applied Cryogenics]] located in Times Square. En route, he discovered his girlfriend [[Michelle]] was cheating on him. When Fry discovered that the pizza delivery was a result of a prank phone call, his mood worsened. When New Year's arrived at midnight, he toasted to “another lousy millennium,” only for him to lose his balance on his chair and fall backward into an open cryogenic tube and was frozen for 1000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot;&gt;''[[Space Pilot 3000]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOriginally, Nibbler caused Fry to lose his balance by blowing on his chair. However, while trying to defeat the [[Brainspawn]], Fry was trapped in the [[Infosphere]] with the Brainspawn due to his [[Scooty-Puff, Jr.]] falling apart, and he travelled back in time to December 31, 1999 to confront Nibbler. Nibbler made Fry realize that if there was one thing in the future worth saving, it was [[Leela]], and Fry blew on the chair himself, causing his past self to fall into the cryogenics tube.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Why of Fry]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Why of Fry]]''&lt;/ref&gt; While the police offered to search for Fry, his parents decided it would be a waste of taxpayer money.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Jurassic Bark]]&quot;&gt;''[[Jurassic Bark]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Fry is actually 1,026 in the year 3000. But from the events in [[Bender's big score|Bender's Big Score]] Fry is actually around 2030. By the time of [[Into the Wild Green Yonder]], Fry is around 2035, seeing as &quot;Into the Wild Green Yonder&quot; takes place in [[3009]]. As of the 10th broadcast season (in [[3013]]), he is 1039.\n\nIn [[Bender's Big Score]], Fry travelled back in time to the year 1999 twice and created two copies of himself. The first copy had accidentally fallen into the same cryogenic tube he was frozen in and the second copy remained in the year 2000. It was revealed that if Fry ''had'' stayed in the 20th century, he would have gotten a job at an aquarium . After he was attacked by Bender, he found out that his characteristics (mainly his hair and voice) were different, so the clone Fry called himself [[Lars Fillmore|&amp;nbsp;Lars Fillmore]]. He, unfortunately, was killed when the Bender duplicate exploded on December 31, 3007. The current and only remaining copy of Fry at this point was unfrozen from his chamber in the 31st century after being frozen for the second time, chronologically aging his preserved body yet another 1000 years.\n\n==Life in the 30th and 31st century==\n{{Quote|My God... it's the future! My parents, my coworkers, my girlfriend. I'll never see any of them again! Yahoo!|Philip J. Fry in ''[[Space Pilot 3000]]''}}\n[[File:Futurama.jpg|thumb|right|Fry frozen at [[Applied Cryogenics]].]]\n\nFry awoke on December 31, 2999. After a few minutes, he realized that he was in the future and was subsequently greeted by [[Terry]], who exclaimed, “Welcome to the World of Tomorrow!” Fry then met Leela, who informed him that he would be assigned the career of delivery boy and that he has one living relative, his great, great, great .... great nephew, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth.\n\nBefore Leela was able to implant the delivery boy [[career chip]] into Fry's hand, however, he ran away and met a robot named Bender. Fry then mistook a [[suicide booth]] for a phone booth, but he and Bender escaped death (to Bender's somewhat disappointment). Eventually, Fry found Professor Farnsworth and became a delivery boy for the Planet Express Delivery Company.\n\nFry had wanted a robot as a best friend since he was six years old, so when he defrosted in the 31st century, he was excited to meet Bender. When they first met, he thought Bender was some &quot;Cheesy New Year's Costume&quot;. Bender was his first friend in the 31st century - &lt;ref name=&quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot; /&gt; they became close friends and eventually, after the crew kicked Fry out of the [[Planet Express building]], they lived together in [[Robot Arms Apts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;[[I, Roommate]]&quot;&gt;''[[I, Roommate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHis career at Planet Express has been nothing short of eventful: During his employment, Fry has rediscovered the original moon landing site,&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Series Has Landed]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Series Has Landed]]''&lt;/ref&gt; discovered he was rich and then subsequently got scammed out of it by [[Mom]] and her sons,&lt;ref name=&quot;[[A Fishful of Dollars]]&quot;&gt;''[[A Fishful of Dollars]]''&lt;/ref&gt; become Emperor of the planet [[Tri-Sol]] after drinking their current emperor (but later got chased off the throne,)&lt;ref name=&quot;[[My Three Suns]]&quot;&gt;''[[My Three Suns]]''&lt;/ref&gt; saved Earth from a giant garbage ball by re-introducing the concept of making trash to 31st-century society,&lt;ref name=&quot;[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]&quot;&gt;''[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]''&lt;/ref&gt; enrolled and dropped out of [[Mars University (location)|Mars University]],&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Mars University]]&quot; /&gt; discovered the secret ingredient of [[Slurm]] with his coworkers,&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory]]&quot;&gt;''[[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory]]''&lt;/ref&gt; prevented Leela from marrying [[Alkazar]] (an alien posing as the only other remaining member of the Cyclops race),&lt;ref name=&quot;[[A Bicyclops Built for Two]]&quot;&gt;''[[A Bicyclops Built for Two]]''&lt;/ref&gt; aided in the discovery of the Lost City of [[Atlanta]],&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Deep South]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Deep South]]''&lt;/ref&gt; become infested by worms that made him intelligent, physically fit, and able to play the [[holophoner]],&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Parasites Lost]]&quot;&gt;''[[Parasites Lost]]''&lt;/ref&gt; saved Earth and then the universe from the [[Brainspawn]] due to him lacking the [[delta brainwave]],&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Why of Fry]]&quot; /&gt; saved the Planet Express crew from [[Roberto]] whilst believing he was a robot,&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Insane in the Mainframe]]&quot;&gt;''[[Insane in the Mainframe]]''&lt;/ref&gt; gotten married to and subsequently divorced from Leela,&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Time Keeps on Slippin']]&quot;&gt;''[[Time Keeps on Slippin']]''&lt;/ref&gt; become his own grandfather (the reason he lacks a delta brainwave),&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Roswell that Ends Well]]&quot;&gt;''[[Roswell that Ends Well]]''&lt;/ref&gt; helped in discovering Leela's parents and the fact that Leela is a [[mutant]] (and not an alien as previously believed),&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Leela's Homeworld]]&quot;&gt;''[[Leela's Homeworld]]''&lt;/ref&gt; become a superhero,&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Less than Hero]]&quot;&gt;''[[Less than Hero]]''&lt;/ref&gt; discovered his old dog fossilized at a museum exhibit of a twentieth-century pizzeria,&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Jurassic Bark]]&quot; /&gt; and written and performed an opera by playing a holophoner while he possessed the [[Robot Devil]]'s hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Becoming His Own Grandfather===\n{{Quote|For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!|Professor Farnsworth}}\n{{Quote|But existing is basically all I do!|Fry}}\n\nThe Planet Express crew had gone to observe a supernova up close. While the crew prepared for the event, Fry went to make popcorn. He ignores the warning label on the aluminum popcorn pan saying not to cook in a microwave, which he does. The microwave emitted radiation that collided with the wave from the supernova, causing the Planet Express crew to travel back in time to [[Roswell that Ends Well|1947]].\n\nAfter Bender breaks apart, Zoidberg was captured by the U.S. military while picking pieces of his torso. Fry and Bender's head attempt to infiltrate Roswell, with the former disguised as a soldier. He runs into his grandfather, [[Enos Fry]], engaged to [[Mildred Fry|Mildred]]. Acting on Farnworth's warning, Fry did his best to make sure that his grandfather was not killed- otherwise he in turn would cease to exist. However, he became paranoid in his attempts to protect Enos, driving and locking him in a house in the middle of nowhere - a house that was, unbeknownst to Fry - within range of a nuclear testing ground. Needless to say, Enos was killed in the resulting explosion, but for some reason, Fry was still existing.\n\nHe then returned to comfort his soon-to-be grandmother, who began to make sexual advances on him, which made him uncomfortable. He then reasoned with himself that because he still exists, Mildred couldn't be his grandmother and had sex with her. The next day, Professor Farnsworth, Leela and Bender knocked on the window, informing Fry that because of his actions, he himself became his own grandfather; Fry realized what he had done and freaked out. Because of the paradox, the Planet Express crew decided that they should get back to their own time, regardless of what it would do to change history. They stormed Roswell, rescuing Zoidberg during an autopsy, Bender's reconstructed body and stealing a microwave satellite dish to return to the future.\n\nIt was later explained by the [[Nibblonians]] that as a result of Fry becoming his own grandfather, a genetic abnormality caused him to lack the [[delta brainwave]], rendering him immune to the [[Brainspawn]] and telepathy in general.\n\n==Death==\n\nBetween [[Into The Wild Green Yonder]] and [[Rebirth]], Fry died and Leela replaced him with a look-alike robot. Then, it short-circuited, putting her into a coma. Fry came back to life after his hair and some skin that was left in the machine rebirthed him. Fry also killed his alternate-universe self after traveling so far forward in a time machine that he arrived in a new universe that was 10 feet lower than the previous universe, crushing the alternate-universe Fry, Bender, and the Professor.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Michelle]]===\n[[File:Michelle.jpg|thumb|right|Michelle]]\n{{Quote|Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.|Philip J. Fry in ''[[The Cryonic Woman]]''}}\n\nFry has had several relationships throughout the years. Before being frozen for 1000 years, he was dating Michelle. However, he discovered that she was cheating on him on New Year's Eve while delivering a pizza to Applied Cryogenics ordered by Nibbler under the name “I.C. Weiner”.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot; /&gt;\n\nWhile working at Applied Cryogenics (due to Leela mixing up their old career chips), he discovers Michelle frozen in one of the cryogenic tubes. Once she is unfrozen, they briefly rekindle their relationship, but after Fry realizes how bossy she really is, he decides to leave her.\n\nLater in the episode, Fry somehow still believes they are still dating, but Michelle later leaves him for [[Pauly Shore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Cryonic Woman]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Cryonic Woman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n\n\n===[[Umbriel]]===\n[[File:Umbriel.jpg|thumb|right|Umbriel]]\n{{Quote|Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?|Philip J.

Leela, Bender, and Zoidberg found out that the website Fry had used to download the Lucy Liubot, [[Nappster]], was actually kidknapping heads and using their images to create robots like Lucy Liu.\n\nFry was eventually convinced by the real Lucy Liu's head to blank his Lucy Liubot by telling him that downloading her image was stealing.

This occurred after Fry accidentally killed his own grandfather, or who he thought was his grandfather, by locking him in a cabin located on an atomic bomb test site that was subsequently blown to pieces during one such test.\n\nDue to these happenings, Fry became his own grandfather. However, as the crew returned to the future, Mildred was left alone to raise Fry's father, Yancy Fry Sr.\n\nAs strange as it may sound, Fry seems to be very proud of doing &quot;the nasty in the pasty&quot;.\n\n===[[Amy Wong]]===\n[[File:Amy.jpg|thumb|right|Amy Wong]]\n{{Quote|I'm doing my job — there's Amy.

Also, one of the episodes took place in 1947, which is 1974, only with the 4 and 7 swapped.\n*Fry may have a form of [[Wikipedia:synesthesia|synesthesia]], a neurological disorder wherein the sufferer mixes up sensory input.

The form is more likely to be the rare ''lexical ''form, where different phenomenon may cause 'color, smell, sound, or taste sensations' like the quotes above.\n*Fry states he cannot swim on at least two occasions: [[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory]] and [[The Sting]].\n*Fry's middle initial is the same as several of [[Matt Groening]]'s other creations, [[wikipedia:Homer Simpson|Homer J. Simpson]], [[wikipedia:Bart Simpson|Bartholomew J. Simpson]], and [[wikipedia:Abe Simpson|Abraham J. Simpson]]. It is currently unknown what Fry's middle name is, although in ''Bender's Big Score'', a New York City telephone directory from the time Fry lived there lists a Philip Joshua Fry alongside a few other Philip Fry's. Bender tracks Fry down using one of the listings shown, but which one is not known.\n*Mostly due to the events of ''Bender's Big Score'', there is virtually no timeline in which Fry is not killed by Bender at least once.\n*It seems Fry has heart problems, In Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory, he told Leela how he use to drink 20 cokes a day until his third heart attack. In Ghost in the Machine, Fry receives a heart attack from being scared by Bender and in &quot;[[Fry Am the Egg Man]]&quot;, he comes close to a heart attack after eating fast food. But he takes a pez and his heart attack stops.\n*It would seem Fry's favorite song would be &quot;[[Walking on Sunshine]]&quot;, wich he normally sings, out of tune albeit, but nonetheless, [[Zoidberg]] even mentioned it, saying &quot;where's Fry, what with the walking on sunshine&quot; (note, this is not a direct quote, but rather a paraphrased version)\n\n==Gallery==\n&lt;gallery&gt;\nFry Looking Squint.jpg\nFry.png\nFrycon.png\nGL - Frys.png\nLeelafry-1.png\nFile:FryLeelaBender.png\nFryonthemoon.png\nSpanishFry.jpg\nFryhead.png\nPhilip J.

[[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] decides to give everyone on Earth a $300 tax rebate in the form of a &quot;Tricky-Dick Fun Bill.&quot; With the money, everyone goes off and has their own adventure. [[Amy]] comments that with $300 you could only buy about 100 cups of coffee, so [[Fry]] decides to do just that. [[Leela]] decides to swim with [[Mushu]], a whale at a theme park, and in the process rescues one of [[Lt. Kif Kroker|Kif]]'s gifts for Amy, a watch that tells the time wherever they both are, which was accidentally swallowed by the whale. Kif also rents a paddle-plane for his date with Amy. Amy, however, spends her entire rebate on a talking devil tattoo.\n[[File:300 dollar bill.jpg|thumb|right|The Tricky-Dick Fun Bill.]]\n[[Professor Farnsworth]] spends his rebate on stem cells from [[Geneworks SKG]], which he uses to make himself look younger and date a [[Farnsworth's girlfriend|young woman]], who had used her rebate to make herself look skinny. When the stem cells wear off, the teenager reveals her secret by pulling her plug, a belly ring, and suddenly becoming fat. The two lovers decide that they still love each other, and continue making out.\n\nBender goes to [[Hacking Jack's Fine Smokables]] looking for a high-class cigar, but ends up finding one that costs ten thousand dollars, because it was rolled in the [[United States]] Constitution by Queen Elizabeth in her &quot;wild years.&quot; He cannot afford it, but instead, buys some burglar's equipment and steals it. He is pursued by [[Smitty]] and [[URL]].\n\n[[Hermes]] buys his son, [[Dwight]], a pair of [[Bamboo Boogie-Boots]]. The shoes have bamboo poles that extend from them, lifting the wearer into the air. However, Dwight had no intention of having fun and only wanted the money for investments. Hermes tries on the boots but is unable to control himself, forcing Dwight to climb on top of him.\n\nFry continues his coffee binge, overdosing more and more on caffine and becoming increasingly short tempered, twitchy and addicted to his drink.\n\nWhile before swimming with Mushu, Leela stuffs her swimsuit with rotten fish, having no other place to store it. Mushu, as planned, eats all the rotten fish, but also eats her swimsuit, leaving Leela naked in the pool.\n\n[[Dr. John Zoidberg|Zoidberg]] tries to find something good to spend the rebate on, but can't find the right thing to spend it on. Eventually, after his efforts to buy art was mocked by Mom, Zoidberg finds happiness buying turkey dogs for his friends and some hobos.\n\nThe [[Planet Express crew]] is invited to a gala hosted by Nixon's head. The riches from the conquest of Tarantulon 6 are on display, but are ruined when Hermes crashes through the window, causing Bender's cigar to fly into the tapestry, setting it on fire. Even worse, the fire door is on fire. Luckily, Fry who by this point is badly trembling and unable to say anything but coffee manages to drink his hundredth cup of coffee and enters a calming hyper-speed state, regaining control of himself and enabling him to rescue everyone and put out the fire.\n\nOutside, everyone is confused and Leela believes they were saved by [[Fry|&quot;a mysterious orange blur&quot;]].

While escaping in the [[Planet Express ship]], it wakes up. [[Fry]] stands in front of Leela to protect her, but it runs him right through, its sting only pricking Leela, but killing Fry. [[Bender]] tosses the bee into the airlock and shoots it into space, where it gets hit by a space-truck. Later, a funeral is held and Fry's coffin is shot into space. During the funeral, [[Kug]] from [[Amazon Women In The Mood]] says he was great for snu snu while a gallery of women including [[Morgan Proctor]], [[Petunia]], a radiator it's hinted at that he had sexual intercourse with in [[The Lesser of Two Evils]], [[21st century woman]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michelle]] say, using body language, 'eh, not so much'.\n[[File:SpaceBeeBender.jpg|thumb|Bender as a space bee.]]\nLater that night, after Fry's funeral, Leela starts to develop strange dreams, all ending with Fry telling her, &quot;You have to wake up.&quot; The other employees of [[Planet Express]] start to get concerned about her, thinking she is going insane. Later that night, Leela has a dream where Fry gives her his jacket, only to wake up with his jacket, which she finds out the next day is really her off-the-rack lime green jacket. The crew finds out that she has been eating space honey. [[Zoidberg]] warns her that one spoonful calms her down, two helps her sleep but three will put her in a sleep so deep that she'll never wake up.\n\nLater, Leela eats some space honey to calm herself and spills the royal jelly on the couch, which turns into a naked, sticky and confused Fry who asks, &quot;Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?&quot;. According to the [[Hubert Farnsworth|Professor]]'s [[Gizmometer]], the royal jelly Fry had fallen in during the mission had an imprint of his DNA, causing him to reform when it mixed with Fry's hair and skin in the couch. However, when he asks Leela to &quot;wake up&quot;, she finds out that this is just another dream.\n\nWhen Leela flies out into space to retrieve Fry's dead corpse and keep under her mattress to remind herself that he is really dead, she instead finds a color changing tunnel. She wakes up in her apartment with the other employees' faces on the walls yelling, &quot;You killed Fry!&quot; Thinking she is insane, she decides to take enough space honey to sleep and dream forever. Fry's picture beside her bed talks to her, and she throws the jar at a small bee, making more smaller bees. He begins saying &quot;wake up&quot;, and she wakes up with a sobbing, dishevelled, unshaven Fry saying &quot;wake up&quot; beside her in a bed in the hospital. Apparently, the stinger went through Fry and she got all the poison. The others come in and are shocked to see her awake. Bender states that she was &quot;in the best coma he had ever seen&quot;, for two weeks. [[Amy]] says the doctor said she would never wake up. She also states that Fry never left her side for a second. Obviously, Leela hearing Fry say &quot;wake up&quot; was Fry saying this in the real world. The episode then ends with them hugging and both whispering that the other needs to take a shower.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Death, Injury===\n* The noisily horrible deaths of the previous Planet Express crew are played out on their ship's black box.\n* Fry's emergency high-speed escape-pack crisis response unit slams him against a few walls.\n* At least one space-bee explodes while chasing the Planet Express crew.\n* Fry and Leela are both stung by the baby queen space-bee they are bringing home, resulting in Fry's death.\n* The space-bee that Leela intended to bring home is smashed on the windshield of a passing space-truck.\n* After a commercial break, Bender is on fire from the waist up, for reasons that are not explained.\n* Leela watches the other crew members explode one-at-a-time as a space-bee stings them.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* Bender impersonates a space-bee.\n* Amy and then Hermes speak to Leela in Farnsworth's voice, and Bender in Amy's voice.\n* Fry appears variously as a zombie, a strangely romantic version of himself, a version of himself made of royal jelly and his bodily fluids from the couch, and a talking photograph on Leela's nightstand.\n* The other crew members serve as wallpaper and carpeting in Leela's house.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nAfter their harrowing escape from the space-bees, Fry suddenly has feelings for Leela again. He realizes that he doesn't want anything to happen to her, and comments that they need to be more careful. When the baby queen space-bee attacks, Fry puts his body between the bee and Leela to protect her.\n\nWhile Leela is in a coma she seems to have a lot more affection for Fry than she ever has before, perhaps prompted by Fry's death. In one of Leela's coma-dreams, Fry is very romantic, and she enjoys it. The alert viewer might notice that something is clearly amiss with Fry being genuinely romantic with Leela. We have seen from the beginning that Fry has no capacity for romance, and usually approaches Leela with brazen lust even while thinking to himself that he is in fact being romantic.\n\nWhen jelly-Fry comes into being, Leela expresses great relief that &quot;Fry&quot; is now alive. She says nothing about feelings for him, in fact clearly denying any such feelings with, &quot;Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad.&quot;\n\nWhen Leela has reached the end of her rope, she muses, &quot;The only time I feel alright is in my dreams,&quot; then looking at Fry's picture she adds, &quot;with you.&quot; Perhaps here we see that Leela has feelings for Fry that she's not entirely conscious of--she constantly denies having such feelings but here she clearly has some. Fry's photo says to Leela, &quot;I love you,&quot; but her hallucinations frighten her so much that she is unable to respond.\n\nWhen Leela wakes in the hospital, we realize that everything Fry said in her coma-dream was said by the real Fry at her bedside for two weeks. This is not the first time Fry has said, &quot;I love you&quot; to Leela, but perhaps going through this experience has matured him somewhat, which would finally give some meaning to the words. Their embrace, lacking a kiss, suggests that even if Leela has begun finally to see the desired maturity in Fry, she's still comfortable being just friends with him.\n\n===Character Arcs===\nThe alert viewer might be very suspicious when Bender, whose lifelong dream is to be a folk singer, and who has sung numerous times in numerous episodes, claims that he's not allowed to sing due to a &quot;court order.&quot; This is a hint that we're in an alternate reality, just as are Fry's genuinely romantic gestures.\n\n===Hermes-isms===\n* ''Sweet three-toed sloth of Ice Planet Hoth''\n==Footnotes==\n&lt;references/&gt;\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

The movie is written by [[Ken Keeler]] and [[David X. Cohen]]. Established characters appearing include the [[Nibbler|Nibblonians]], [[Seymour]], [[Barbados Slim]], [[Morbo]], [[Santa Claus Robot]], the [[God Entity]], [[Al Gore (character)|Al Gore]], and [[Zapp Brannigan]]. The plot also heavily involves several new characters; a trio of [[Nudist Alien Scammers]], [[Head Museum]] technician [[Lars Fillmore]] and a narwhal named [[Leelu]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAn owl flies through a small hole into [[Planet Express building]], where [[Hermes]] gives out the staff roll call, but when they get to the [[Professor]], he says that they're all fired. He claims that in [[3005]], the executives of the ''Box Network'', an allusion to the [[wikipedia:Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]], canceled [[Planet Express]]'s contract; no one told the [[Planet Express crew|crew]] for two years. Now those executives have been fired for incompetence and ground into [[Torgo's Executive Powder|a fine, pink powder]], so Planet Express is back &quot;on the air.&quot; They throw a party to celebrate, during which [[Hermes]] is decapitated by a saber sword and his body crushed by the [[Planet Express ship]]. His [[Head in Jar|head]] is placed in a jar while his body is repaired. The man that performs the procedure, [[Lars Fillmore]], takes an immediate liking to [[Leela]], much to [[Fry]]'s chagrin. Meanwhile, [[LaBarbara Conrad]] goes back to her former husband, Barbados Slim, claiming that [[Dwight]] needs a father, not two half fathers.\n[[File:Nude beach planet.JPG|thumb|right|The Nude Beach Planet]]\nDuring a delivery to a [[nude beach planet]], [[Bender]]  makes fun of Fry's &quot;wiener&quot;, and Fry decides to leave to go deliver the package. When he finds the right person, he uses his penis as a pen to sign for the package. Leela finds a tattoo of Bender on Fry's ass, of which Fry was unaware. While on the beach, a trio of [[Nudist Alien Scammers]] use flimsy excuses to get the entire Planet Express crew to sign petitions and provide their e-mail addresses.[[File:20rzgo.png|thumb|Leela dicovering the Time Sphere.]]\n\nUpon returning to [[Earth]], the entire crew receives hundreds of spam messages. The crew responds to the offers and Bender is infected with [[iObey|a virus]]. The scammers fool [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] into signing his business over to them, and they show up to take over. Bender's virus compels him to obey the scammers without question. The scammers are drawn to the tattoo on Fry's buttocks, which is revealed to contain the code for a [[Paradox-Free Time Travel Machine]]. Bender reads this binary code, which summons a time sphere from the [[God Entity]]. [[Nibbler]] reveals his sentience, explaining that using the code even ''once'' could destroy the universe, but they ignore him. Nibbler calls in some [[Kitten class attack ship]]s to stop the scammers, only to be defeated by chairs.\n\n[[Nudar]] uses the sphere to go back to last night, meeting his past self and they &quot;ended up at my place, or shall I say, ''our'' place.&quot;, making out with his past self. Farnsworth states that he knows a paradox when he sees it and accidentally crushes &quot;yesterday Nudar&quot; with his [[Smell-O-Scope]].\n[[File:Kitten class attack ships.JPG|thumb|left|Kitten class attack ships]]\nBecause the time portal is only a one way trip and cannot bring anyone back to the present, the scammers have Bender use the code to steal valuable objects from Earth's past, waiting out the time in between in the limestone cave beneath Planet Express. They also have Bender replace the Professor's [[Spheroboom]] [[Doomsday Device|doomsday device]], placing it with a rose with a tag that reads, &quot;You've been scammed, Sweetheart&quot;. During this time, Hermes asks Bender to travel back in time and kill an earlier version of himself for a replacement body. However, [[Zoidberg]] unknowingly attaches Hermes's head the wrong way, making him facing backwards. The angry bureaucrat chases Zoidberg.\n\nMeanwhile, the Professor and the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] analyzes the time-travel code. Though the Professor states that time travel is impossible, [[Ethan &quot;Bubblegum&quot; Tate]] figures out that paradox-free time travel ''is'' possible. The factor that corrects the paradoxes is the doom field, which, if raised exponentially, could destroy the fabric of causality, exactly what Nibbler was trying to tell them. Zoidberg and Hermes run in. The scientists are shocked about Hermes' duplicate body. The doom field results in all time-travel duplicates, including Hermes' new body, to be essentially doomed. Hermes doesn't care, as he will need the duplicate body only long enough to win back LaBarbara.\n\nOnce Bender has stolen everything of value from history, the scammers finally care if the universe gets destroyed. They decide to destroy the time-travel code by killing Fry and blanking Bender's memory. Fry uses the time code to escape to January 1, [[2000]], the day he was frozen, and Bender is sent back to kill him. Bender creates a duplicate of himself when he needs to use the bathroom, going back nineteen seconds. Then another Bender in a tuxedo appears, claiming to be from &quot;way at the end&quot;, putting a rub-on time code on Fry's butt. The second duplicate catches Fry as he appears in the past and attempts to kill him, only to have his feelings for Fry and his inability to urinate to cause an overload. Fry shoves him in a cryogenic-tube before he can explode. Fry leaves and the original Bender fails to catch him. He tries to commit [[Suicide booth|suicide]] only to learn that he was in a 20th century phone booth. He begins to search for Fry, going through a list of names in the phone book. He skips past a hobo named Fry and Fry's former girlfriend [[Michelle]], making out with her new boyfriend, [[Constantine]]. Bender spends the next twelve years hunting Fry and causes [[Al Gore]] to lose the [[2000]] election to George W. Bush. After ending up at [[Yancy Fry|Yancy]]'s house and mistaking [[Philip J. Fry II]] for his friend, he is directed to the North Pole. While attempting to stow aboard a boat, Bender spots a bearded Fry and chases after him, temporarily sidetracked by Al Gore, who can't control his Hybrataxi. Eventually, Bender blows up [[Panucci's Pizza]] when Fry walks inside, also turning [[Seymour]] to [[dolomite]].\n\nOnce Bender returns to report his apparent success, the scammers wipe his memory of the code, fifty terabytes of porn and the virus. Suddenly, Fry shows up at his own funeral. He explains that in the past, he couldn't buy pizza from Panucci's with his futuristic money, so he went to [[Applied Cryogenics]] for free pizza, but it had turned cold. He went back an hour to eat the pizza when it was still warm. He then met his time paradox duplicate, who became disgusted with the main Fry's casual abuse of the time code just to eat pizza and takes the suggestion not to use the code. As soon as his duplicate was gone, Fry realized that his frozen self still had 20th century money. Unfortunately, he accidentally touches his own frozen butt and slips on a chair, which caused him to fall into the tube once again. Once his younger self got out of the tube, the [[3007]] Fry froze himself for 7.95 years. Bender tries to kill him again but the Professor stops him, informing him that when the time code duplicates a living thing, the copy is always doomed. Nibbler destroys the time travel tattoo to keep the scammers from abusing it further, as well as saving 40% of Fry's rectum. The scammers then burst into Fry and Bender's apartment, intent on vaporizing him, but as they check Fry's rear back at Planet Express, they confirm that the code is well and truly gone.\n\nWhat happened to the Fry Bender murdered is also explained. Taking the main Fry's suggestion not to use the time code, this Fry instead decides to live above Punucci's. He lives his 20th century life, delivering pizzas, spending time with his family, using his [[seven leaf clover]] against [[Yancy Fry|Yancy]] in [[basketball]] and hanging out with his beloved dog Seymour. Eventually, he gets over Leela, deciding to find his own purpose in life. When he sees a poor narwhal named [[Leelu]] on television, he decides to be her caretaker, as he is the only one who can assist her in eating. When Leelu is released back into the wild, Fry enlists Panucci's cousin [[Leroy]] to find Leelu and bring her back to [[Old New York|New York]]. After two years, and 108 narwhals later, setting them all free and eating nothing but sausage, they find her. Noticing that Leelu is interested in a male narwhal, Fry decides to let her go.\n[[File:FryandLeelu.jpg|thumb|right|Fry and Leelu]]\nEven during this depression, Leela and Lars decide to get married. Fry tries to stop the wedding by replacing a pen full of ink with a pen with no ink, but Lars had an extra. Meanwhile, Hermes was able to win back LaBarbara by zippering up her dress, which Barbados was unable to do. Leela accidentally hits Hermes with the empty pen, resulting in a chandelier slicing off his head and crushing his duplicate body. The Professor explains that he expected that, since all duplicates are doomed. Lars becomes agitated by this news and calls off the wedding. LaBarbara leaves Hermes again for Barbados, even though his original body is almost repaired.\n\n[[Richard Nixon]], [[President of Earth]], is tricked into selling Earth to the scammers and everyone is forced to emigrate off the planet. The Planet Express crew moves to [[Neptune]]. After learning that [[Santa Claus Robot|Robot Santa]] was cheated out of his naughty list, Leela decides it's time to fight back and forces Santa to help them. Though they had enough ships to mount a rag tag attack, Nixon says that the scammers have a fleet of solid gold Death Stars defending Earth. However, Santa grants them access to his factory for weapons and calls in his holiday friends, [[Kwanzabot]] and the [[Chanuka Zombie]]. [[Zapp Brannigan]] arrives to take command, but before the fleet can link computers with the [[Nimbus]], the Death Stars de-cloak and send it crashing to the ground; Leela then takes de facto command. Unfortunately, she can't coordinate so many ships, so Hermes offers his bureaucratic highly organised mind. He destroys all the Death Stars; this helps Hermes win back LaBarbara much to Slims annoyance. However, the scammers have one last trick, the Sphere-O-Boom doomsday device that Bender had stolen for them. The scammers demand their surrender, but Bender reveals that he stole it back after being released from their control. The crew fires the device at the scammers' ship, destroying it. On New Year's Day, [[3008]], Bender explains that while sawing off the Professor's hand with a dull saw, he figured that he needed the doomsday device for himself. Once he was out of the scammer's control, he &quot;pulled the old switchoroo&quot;. Nixon awards him The Dirty Doublecross in light of his actions.\n\nFry sees that Leela is still unhappy that Lars left her at the altar and tries to get them back together. However, just as Lars is about to tell Fry something important, the reunion is cut short by [[Nudar]], who survived the doomsday device through use of a doomsday device-proof vest (musing that he wished he'd worn matching pants). Nudar claims that the time-travel code still exists and is on Lars. Lars tricks him into approaching the cryo-tube with Bender on overload; once that Bender is released, the explosion kills them both. The explosion singes off some of Lars' clothing, revealing the time-travel tattoo. A flashback explains that Lars is actually Fry's duplicate, having survived Bender's attack in [[2012]], which burned off his hair and injured his larynx, deepening his voice. Upon realizing that ''he'' was Lars, the duplicate Fry froze himself to return to the future and be with Leela, hitching a ride in Michelle's tube, arriving in [[3002]] and taking a job at the [[Head Museum]]. However, he realizes at the wedding that, as a duplicate, he was doomed, so he left Leela at the altar to spare her the pain of becoming a widow.\n[[File:Futurama benders.jpg|thumb|right|Bender and his time duplicates]]\nDuring the funeral, Bubblegum and Nibbler state that nothing makes sense anymore, so someone will have to travel back and put the time tattoo on Fry in the first place; this job Bender did, by removing the tattoo from Lars and traveling into the past to place it on the Fry frozen in the [[Cryogenic tube]]. Upon returning, Bender reveals that he had convinced his time-travel duplicates in the cave to remain with him instead of emerging when they were logically supposed to. Then they all emerge together. Nibbler, horrified, shouts &quot;Everyone out of the Universe!&quot;, before eating himself out of existence. Though Bender doesn't see the problem, the sheer number of time-paradox Benders spontaneously explode, causing a giant tear in the universe. &quot;Well, we're boned,&quot; says the normal, non-doomed, Bender. This tear in the universe leads into the next movie ''[[The Beast With a Billion Backs]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Billy West]] as [[Philip J. Fry]]/[[Lars Fillmore]],[[Professor Farnsworth]],[[John A. Zoidberg]] and additional voices.\n\n*[[Katey Sagal]] as [[Turanga Leela]]\n\n*[[John DiMaggio]] as [[Bender Bending Rodríguez]] and additional voices.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*In the opening they make fun of Box Network. This is a reference to Futurama's cancellation by the Fox Network.\n*[[Fleb]] is reading a book called &quot;A Brief History of Time Travel&quot;, copyright [[4972]].\n*While on a date, Leela and Lars visit the &quot;[[Cylon War Memorial Make Out Point]]&quot;, a reference to [[Wikipedia:Battlestar Galactica|Battlestar Galactica]].\n*When the film was cut into separate episodes, the three additional opening captions were: &quot;Watch, Rinse, Repeat&quot;, &quot;Apply directly to the foreclaw&quot; (a reference to HeadOn), and &quot;Last Known Transmission of the Hubble Telescope&quot;.\n*[[Eric Cartman's head]] can be seen in the Head Museum (next to Cartman's head, you can see [[w:c:simpsons:Troy McClure|Troy McClure's head]]).\n*Apu's head from [[The Simpsons]] is seen in the head museum for the second time. The first was [[Space Pilot 3000]].\n*Leelu's name is a possible reference to the film 'The Fifth Element'.\n*The title may be a reference to the 1972 film 'Shaft's Big Score' starring Richard Roundtree.\n* In Santa's workshop, the toys are a possible reference to the comic, &quot;Life in Hell&quot; by [[Matt Groening]].\n* Bender's email, bender@ilovebender.com, is a real domain.\n* Some of the aircraft seen in Neptune when the Planet Express crew are preparing to fight arainst the scamming aliens seem to be based on real commercial airliners. \n* While Amy's is checking her laptop and gets spammed ads. You can see an ad that says Watch! Comedy Central, which is an allusion to the series getting picked up by Comedy Central a year later.\n* The code of codes (Machine Language Time Code) is\n&lt;pre&gt;001100\n010010\n011110\n100001\n101101\n110011\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n* The code is a count from 1 (001) to 6 (110) in binary, mirrored vertically.\n* Professor Farnsworth's Bank Account Number is 299792458. This is the same as the speed of light in a vacuum, 299,792,458&amp;nbsp;m/s.\n* 001100010010011110100001 is 3,221,409 in [[Wikipedia:Binary numeral system|Binary numeral system]]\n* Some of the greatest treasures of humanity stolen by Bender include: an unfinished ''Mona Lisa ''painting'' by ''[[Leonardo Da Vinci]], Tutankhamun mask, a ''Sunflowers ''painting by Vincent van Gogh, the Gutenberg Bible, the KFC secret recipe (chicken, grease and salt) written on the Gutenburg Bible, a United States flag, Eddie Van Halen guitar, the ''Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas ''sign, R2-D2, the ''David'' by Michelandelo with his genitals censored, a Moai, a cross (possibly the one used to crucifiy Jesus Christ) and Vince Lombardi trophies.\n*Bender travels back in time to the year 2308 where he steals the noble peace prize and is pursued by Swedish Authorities which causes him to duplicate his ship into an army that soon heads to New York where they destroy the city except the Applied Cryogenics where fry is frozen. This reveals that Bender is responsible for the creation of the second middle age which soon go on to be birth the city of New New York   \n* Fry unfroze in 3007 on December 12, at around 3:30 in the afternoon, if the estimate of around 4 pm is true when he first unfroze in 2999. This figure is determined due to his spending 7.95 years in the cryo-tube.\n\n== DVD Extras/Special Features ==\n* Commentary by Matt Groening, David X Cohen, Billy West, John DiMaggio, Phil LaMarr, Claudia Katz, Dwayne Carey-Hill and Ken Keeler\n* Futurama Returns A live comic book reading by the Futurama Cast\n* [[Everybody Loves Hypnotoad: &quot;Amazon Adventure&quot;]], A full length episode\n* Deleted Storyboard Scenes\n* A Terrifying Message from Al Gore, animated promo for An Inconvenient Truth, featuring [[Bender]], [[Billy West]] and [[Al Gore]]\n* Bite My Shiny Metal X, a Futurama Maths Lecture\n* Script: First Draft\n* New Character/Design Sketches\n* Original 5-minute Comic-Con Promo\n* Futurama: Beast With a Billion Backs, Trailer\n* Easter Egg - Ken Keeler Sketch\n\n== Goofs ==\n* In the climax of the film when Leela, Lars, and Fry are at the cryogenics lab, it is day. However, in the scene before this, it is night and Fry told Leela to meet him up there in 5 minutes. Although the new year of [[3008]] was being celebrated outside, so this could have been sometime after midnight while the sun was beginning to rise.\n* In &quot;[[Future Stock]]&quot;, Fry's butt is clear of any Bender tattoo. It is possible that at that point in time, Bender hadn't placed the tattoo on his butt yet.\n* In front of Panucchi's there is a tree outfront in &quot;Jurassic Bark&quot;; the tree is cut down during &quot;Seymour's&quot; tragic montage years towards the end. In &quot;Bender's Big Score&quot;, there is no tree on Jan 1, 2000 01:01hrs.\n** However, this is unlikely because Bender is seen in the movie appearing and putting the code on him while he was in the Cryogenic tube shortly after he was frozen.\n* [[Michelle]]'s boyfriend's name was Charles in &quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot;, but this could be his middle name.\n* When Hermes asks Bender to go back in time to steal his body, Bender's eyes return to normal for the rest of the scene.\n* After Hermes gets decapitated at Lars and Leela's wedding, Lrrr's horns are discolored white. They are supposed to be brown.\n* Fry's nephew Phillip J. Fry II is seen in this movie, as a child, with red hair.

They are an interesting echo of the chronotons from [[Time Keeps On Slippin']], as the chronotons caused time to jump only ''forward'', while the time-spheres can be used to go only ''backward'' in time.\n\n*Nudar is the first to use the time sphere, going back to yesterday and seducing himself. The Nudar from last night is killed when Farnsworth's Smell-O-Scope falls on him. That is, the &quot;original&quot; Nudar, the one who used the time-sphere, is still alive.\n\n*After Nudar, Bender uses the time-code uncounted times to go to the past, steal priceless artifacts, and return them to his scammer masters. He suggests that he may have fatally harmed Leonardo da Vinci, and it is shown that his flight from the Swedish authorities matches one of the apocalyptic scenes that was depicted while Fry was in cryogenic stasis.\n\n*Bender goes into the past and brings back a Hermes-body. Zoidberg attaches present-Hermes' head to the past-Hermes' body, but we know by now, from Nudar's experience, that this body from the past is doomed to destruction in order to correct for the time paradox.\n\n*Fry, in the year 3007, escapes from Nudar by using the time-code to go back to Jan 1, 2000 at 12:30am. He fights with the self-destructing Bender, kicks him into a cryo-tube, and goes to Panucci's Pizza, arriving at 1:00am. He then returns to the cryogenics lab and goes back in time one hour. He watches himself fighting Bender, argues with that self, and falls back into the cryo-tube with the &quot;native&quot; Fry who is already inside and frozen.\n\n*The Fry who fights Bender while the first Fry watches is the Fry who becomes Lars. This Fry goes to Panucci's Pizza one minute later than the non-doomed Fry, at 1:01am. Rather than going back to the cryogenics lab for pizza, this Fry goes on to begin his 21st century life by delivering pizzas, spending time with his family before pursuing, catching, and release a whale named Leelu. He returns to his apartment above Panucci's Pizza in 2012 and is injured by Bender's assassination attempt losing his hair and damaging his larynx and realizing at that moment that he is in fact Lars.\n\n*&quot;Lars&quot; then heads for the Cryogenic Labs where hitching a ride in his ex-girlfriend's tube, he returns to the future awakening in 3002 where he works a head in a jar feeder and waits for the fateful day to meet Leela.\n\n*Bender, in the year 3007, goes back to Jan 1, 2000, at 12:28am, in order to assassinate Fry. There is no indication whatsoever how Bender knew to aim for that particular moment in time. It seems to have no significance to any part of the story. This same Bender goes back in time again, by 19 seconds, to ask the Bender at that time to stand guard for a restroom break.\n\n*Bender from &quot;way at the end&quot; arrives while the other Bender is in the restroom. End-Bender chats briefly with the Bender keeping watch, tattoos &quot;native&quot; Fry's butt in the cryo-tube, and then disappears silently, presumably to wait in the limestone cavern.\n\n*Fry arrives at the cryogenics lab on Jan 1, 2000, at 12:30am, while Bender awaits him. This Bender goes into self-destruct sequence under the pressure of the conflict between his orders and his loyalty to Fry. Until nearly the end of the episode, A Bender is frozen in a cryo-tube after Fry kicks him into it.\n\n*It is the original Bender, who after his trip to the restroom, spends the next 12 years tracking the (doomed) Fry who becomes Lars.\n\n*Non-doomed Fry appears during his own memorial service being held by his fellow crewmembers. He tells the tale of going back to 2000, going back again by one hour for warm pizza, chatting with his paradox time duplicate, falling into the cryo-tube, and restarting the tube set for 7.95 years when the &quot;native&quot; Fry leaves it in 2999.\n\n*At Lars' memorial service, Bender finally goes back in time once more to transfer the tattoo from Lars' butt to the butt of the Fry in the cryo-tube back in the year 2000. When this Bender returns to the present, he has convinced all of the Benders who have ever waited in the limestone cave to stay with him and come up into Planet Express all at once. This results in the rupture in space-time that sets the stage for [[Beast with a Billion Backs|The Beast with A Billion Backs]].\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nTheir holophoner-inspired feelings apparently forgotten, Fry and Leela have returned to their usual relationship mode: Fry with immature, mostly lust-driven &quot;feelings&quot; for Leela, and Leela wishing Fry were more mature. Fry's emotional repertoire grows just enough to include jealousy. Leela falls in love with and almost marries Lars, a clear indication that it truly is only Fry's immaturity that makes her dislike him, as maturity is the major difference between Fry and Lars.\n\nBack in the 20th century, the Fry who becomes Lars reconnects with his family and his life, but pines for Leela, until he starts a long relationship with Leelu.\n\nAt Lars' memorial service, Leela seems to have a new appreciation for Fry, but she doesn't articulate it, and Fry moves on to a different woman in the following episode.\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nHermes and Zoidberg argue over the spam email that Zoidberg has received, but there is no particular animosity in the conversation.\n\n===Nibbler===\nNibbler reveals himself to the crew for the third time. It's a surprise to everyone, of course, because Leela and Fry, the only witnesses to his true identity, have both lost their memories of it. This time, he's not careful at all; he charges into Farnsworth's observatory on a hamster and begins pontificating to the whole crew and the scammers about the dangers of using the time-code. After this, Nibbler is rather quiet for the remainder of the episode, finally devouring himself in order to escape from the universe and avoid its apparently imminent destruction when Bender brings up all the other Benders from the limestone cave. As the crew mention in a later episode, Nibbler does not erase anyone's memory at this moment, so they all know his &quot;secret&quot;, but no one talks about it.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* When Bender steals the doomsday device from Farnsworth, he leaves Farnsworth a bag with a rose and a mocking note inside. Per Nudar's command, Bender puts the other bag (the one with the doomsday device) in the safe. When Farnsworth throws his rose-bag out of Zoidberg's office, Bender catches it in his torso. Later, when Bender has been freed from the scammers' obedience virus, Bender recovers the doomsday-bag and saves it in his torso while putting the rose-bag into the safe for Nudar to find later.\n* During his hunt for Fry, Bender encounters a drunk in the gutter named Philip Fry, the same drunk in a house, an aide to Al Gore named Philip Fry, and Fry's nephew Philip. He also nearly mistakes Michelle's new boyfriend, Constantine, for Fry.\n* Yancy Fry refers to Bender as &quot;some kind of trash can&quot;.\n* Santa doubles as a beat box.\n* Leela's [[Wrist LoJack-a-mater]] is also a tissue dispenser.\n\n===Hermes-isms===\n* ''Sweet yeti of the Serengeti''\n\n===Character Arcs===\n* Farnsworth correctly pronounces the word &quot;warned&quot; twice in a sentence.\n* Sal's speech impediment seems to have stabilized for the time being but it seems that he is passing his disorder on to Leela, as she begins pluralizing words when she is around him.\n{{Movies}}\n[[Category:Movies]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 5]]"

[Laughs] Nah, I'm just messing with you, kid. You're alright. That's some face you got, though. I think they got a cream for that. [Laughs again] Nah, you're great. |Flexo|The Lesser of Two Evils}}\n\n'''Bending Unit 22''' (serial '''#3370318'''), better known as '''Flexo''', is a minor character on ''[[Futurama]]''. He is very similar to [[Bender]] and is voiced by the [[John DiMaggio|same actor]]. His and Bender's serial numbers gave both robots much amusement, as both their serial codes are expressible as the sum of two cubes. Flexo has a habit of speaking contrary to how he actually feels, before correcting himself; this is seen most often when he slanders or insults an individual only to add, &quot;Nah, I'm just messin' with ya; you're all right.&quot; When Bender shoves Flexo, the latter says &quot;Thanks, I appreciate that,&quot; laughing but then adding, &quot;Nah, I'm joshing you. That was quite annoying&quot;.\n\nFlexo looks and sounds exactly like Bender with the exception of having a small triangular metal goatee on his chin. Fry accidentally runs him over with a 20th century gasoline-fueled car, a 1992 Latoura, and gives him &quot;ass-whiplash&quot;. He becomes good friends with Bender, inspiring jealousy and suspicion from Fry, especially as Flexo often plays cruel jokes on him such as shooting a jet of poisonous chlorine in Fry's face for no reason. Fry originally believes that Flexo is an evil twin of Bender and suspects that he will try to steal the crown from the Miss Universe pageant. However, it turns out that Bender is the one attempting to steal the crown and Flexo is actually trying to stop him, therefore making Bender the evil twin. The confusion surrounding whether Flexo is good or evil is also not helped by his rather sinister laughter. When the police arrive at the scene, they mistake Flexo for Bender and, at the behest of [[Bob Barker's head]], arrest him instead, sending him to a South American-Turkish prison.\n\nMore proof that Bender is Flexo's evil twin; Bender says that &quot;there must be robots worse than I!&quot;, only to have the Robot Devil say that he &quot;checked around, there really aren't&quot;. Therefore, if Bender is the evil robot, Flexo is less evil than Bender.\n\nIn a deleted scene, Bender is shown scratching out his serial code so the robot mafia will not find him, however the code scratched out is Flexo's, not Bender's. This scene was cut as it was thought to be too confusing and would infuriate fans; the implication seems to be that it was Bender, and not Flexo, who was arrested previously, meaning the Planet Express crew, if not police, had identified the wrong robot.\n\nBender briefly dates Flexo's ex-wife [[Angleyne]]. Once Bender discovers that Angleyne used to be married to Flexo, Bender impersonates Flexo, and, for the second time, Flexo is punished for Bender's behavior when the [[Robot Mafia]] drops a large, unbendable metal beam onto Flexo, crushing him. This could have killed him had he been trapped under it for an entire year, but Bender rescues him. Flexo then gets back together with Angleyne, and the two have sexual intercourse &quot;right there on the factory floor&quot;, apparently with Bender still in the room.\n\nBender later discovers Flexo in a dumpster behind [[CitiHall]] during a community recycling event. Bender asked why he's in a hazardous wastedump, and Flexo stated that bending units like him are heavily outdated, because they overheat, are radioactive, and other reasons unknown because Bender quickly shut the door.\n\n== Allusions ==\nFlexo's goatee is a reference to the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode Mirror, Mirror, in which Kirk and Spock's more aggressive alternates in the parallel Mirror Universe both wore facial hair while the originals did not. That the goatee-wearing Flexo is a &quot;good&quot; version (relatively speaking) of Bender is an inversion of the natures of our universe and the Mirror Universe on ''Star Trek''.\n\nFlexo may be Bender's brother since in the scene when Bender is built his head is in the mix of heads Bender's was selected from therefore they are built by the same robot making them brothers.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n* &quot;[[The Lesser of Two Evils]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Bendless Love]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Attack of the Killer App]]&quot;\n=== Films ===\n*''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''\n[[Category:Planet Express Crew]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Photo Pop Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]"

The Jamaican team had been detained at the airport, so Hermes has been called to take their place. Unfortunately, Hermes hasn't limbo-ed in 20 years, prompting the [[Professor]] to create a [[Flabo Dynamic Suit]] to help him cheat. [[Barbados Slim]], Hermes' rival and [[LaBarbara]]'s ex-husband is also competing, and Hermes has never won to him. Hermes starts off the race well with a lot of cheating, but as he nears the last pole, the suit gives way and the pole is knocked off, disqualifying him. [[Bender]], watching the bending competitions, believes himself to be a shoo-in until he sees some of his fellow competitors. He decides to disguise himself as [[Fembot]] named [[Coilette]], in order to cheat in the [[robot]] Olympics.\n\nBender wins five gold medals for the fictional country of [[Robonia]], but it is revealed that the winners will have their oil tested to confirm that they are actually fembots. He begs the Professor to make a woman out of him, so he undergoes a sex-change operation to replace his testosteroil with fembot lubricants to deceive the judges. Though the Professor warns that he may suffer wild mood swings and runs the risk of becoming a fembot permanently, he decides to go through it anyway. [[Leela]] and [[Amy]] protest, claiming Bender will harm the dignity of women everywhere. The Professor defends that he's doing this &quot;for the proud people of Robonia.&quot; Bender then goes under the sex-change procedure and emerges as Coilette, passes the test and gets to keep his medals. The Professor tells Bender he needs to change back because the Femzoil is getting into his processor, but Bender is invited to appear on the show ''Late night with [[Humorbot 5.0]]''. While on the show, Coilette strikes up a relationship with [[Calculon]] and the two arrange to meet for dinner that night.\n\nCoilette gets ready for her date, over the protests of the crew. Fry is grossed out that his best friend is dating a man and Amy and Leela are upset and embarrassed that Bender is acting like a tramp. After feeling attacked by the crew, Coilette runs out and the Professor shares the fact that Bender is having mood swings and needs the oil change operation.\n\nCoilette and Calculon dine at [[Elzar's Fine Cuisine]]. Calculon says that he wishes to spend some ''quality time'' with Coilette. Bender is initially aghast at this, until Calculon mentions he happens to own the world's largest yacht. Coilette accepts, and the two spend days together. Bender returns to the [[Planet Express building]], showing the crew the gifts Calculon showered Bender with, a vase of puppies amongst them. After a brief exchange between Leela, Amy and Bender, Calculon appears with [[Boxy]] and proposes to Coilette. Bender accepts.\n\nFry tells Bender how much he'll miss him and that he's more like a brother than a sister to him. However, Bender states that he plans to use the marriage to scam Calculon for half his fortune. Leela disapproves, but Bender is dismissive of her concerns. Coilette and Calculon go on a date in a hot-air balloon, where Calculon presents her with the remote control to his heart and offers to give up acting for her, as he truly loves her. Coilette begins to weep.\n\nBack at Planet Express, we see Bender weeping. He cries that he cannot go through with the scam, no longer wishing to hurt Calculon, meaning that he's coming to the final stages of womanhood and the effects will become irreversible soon. Leela offers to help, on condition that Bender will forever return to being a man-bot. When Bender agrees, Leela states there is no way to stop the marriage without hurting him, but as an actor, he is used to 'soap opera pain'.\n\nWe cut to the wedding, the crew wearing a variety of costumes. As the ceremony begins, Coilette faints, causing Calculon to call for a doctor. [[Zoidberg]] appears on cue, diagnosing a case of ''African Hydraulic Fever'', an often fatal disease caught in the Diamond Mines of Africa. It turns out that Coilette has stolen diamonds from the greedy 'Diamanda' (Leela) and her lover 'Congo Jack' (Fry), to return them to their rightful owners, the natives. 'Diamanda' kicks Coilette to the ground, and the enraged 'Congo Jack' hurls a spear at her. It misses, so Coilette fakes deadly impalement on the spear and Calculon swears to honor her memory with a film.\n\nSometime later, at the Planet Express building, Calculon's movie, called ''Coilette, a Calculon Story'' is on the television. The Professor, in the process of turning Bender back into a man-bot, tells them to turn the TV off. One mistake now and Bender will be trapped between genders and become bisexual. As Bender is about to say something heartwarming about Calculon, his antenna pops back up, returning to his old self, causing him to exclaim that he and Calculon could run to Vegas and pick up some fembots. As they continue watching the movie, the rest of the male characters leave, complaining about how Calculon is too emotional towards actor Coilette; Bender looks back with tear-filled eyes. Leela and Amy turn, surprised, and question him. Bender replies that they don't dress trampy enough.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* Bender poses as a fembot olympic athlete named Coilette.\n* Bender undergoes a sex-change operation, becoming Coilette.\n* Zoidberg, Leela, Fry, and Hermes participate in a hastily fabricated skit, at Calculon and Coilette's wedding, to gracefully end the relationship.\n\n===Injury, Dismemberment===\n* Farnsworth repeatedly pounds Bender with a sledgehammer as part of a sex-change operation.\n* Farnsworth cuts off Bender's antenna as part of a sex-change operation.\n* Leela slaps Farnsworth in the face.\n* Numerous robots are injured while Calculon dances with Coilette.\n* Calculon hurls Boxy out of a hot air balloon at altitude.\n* Leela kicks Coilette in the face.\n* Congo Jack &quot;kills&quot; Coilette.\n* As part of a sex-change operation, Farnsworth hurts Bender in some unspecified way, apparently in the groin area, using a hammer and screwdriver.\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

Among its assets are a large number of soldiers and a fleet of ships, which are used to defend its members from attack and to defeat their enemies. The military seems to be similar to that of the UN in that it is composed of the militaries of its member planets rather than having a single, unified force. Much like the United States in the UN, Earth seems to be one of the largest contributors in the DOOP military. The flagship of the fleet, the [[Nimbus]], commanded by Zapp Brannigan, is stationed on [[Earth]], though it often travels to other places in the universe during the course of its duties.

It originally aired in North America on March 13, 2000.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Professor Farnsworth]] brings [[Good news, everyone!|good news]] for the crew; after several years of trying, he has finally logged onto the internet via AOL. The [[Planet Express crew]] gets into their [[Net Suits]] and visits the Internet in a virtual reality simulation. Chased by ads, the crew finds refuge in different pornography websites, including an adult chat room populated by children and a website [[Bender]] created using [[Amy]]'s head on [[Leela]]'s body. Disgusted by the men visiting the Filthy Filthy Chatroom, the women, accompanied by Bender, go into the Filthy Chatroom.\n\nThanks to the Internet, the crew becomes bored with sex. So they pander to their lusts for violence instead and play ''Death Factory III, the legend of Death Factory II''. [[Fry]], an accomplished video game player, dispatches all of the crew easily, including a one-eyed man Leela had been happily chatting with. Leela is furious that Fry has ruined her one chance to learn who she is.\n\nThe crew is en route to [[Cineplex 14]] in order to deliver desperately needed popcorn, when Leela receives an email from [[Alcazar |Alcazar]], the one-eyed man she met online, who invites her to his home. Leela dumps the popcorn and changes course to find where she belongs.\n\nAlcazar greets Leela and 'her servants' and introduces her to [[Cyclopia]] and the forbidden valley, where no one must go. At Alcazar's castle, he tells Leela the story of what happened to their people. He claims that Leela was sent away as a baby when the blind moles of Subterra 3 launched missiles in every direction, hitting forty planets including Cyclopia. Alcazar had been employed as a pool cleaner and was spared from the chaos while fishing out a dead possum. Leela decides to help Alcazar save their race and sleeps with him.\n\nHowever, the next morning, Leela discovers that Alcazar is rude and abusive. Fry doesn't trust Alcazar and attempts to visit the Forbidden Valley, only to fall down a trapdoor and into the dungeon. Leela changes her clothes and hair in an attempt to impress Alcazar, who insults her in front of his friends, [[Pig]], [[Rat Man]] and [[Rat Woman]]. Fry tells Leela that Alcazar is a jerk and is hiding something from her, but she doesn't want to destroy the cyclops race by breaking up with him. Leela gives him a champagne. Fry tries to beat the door open with it, but the cap flies off and hits the 'DOOR RELEASE' button. He celebrates but the door starts to close so he runs under just in time. At dinner, Alcazar proposes to Leela, who accepts.\n\nAll this time, Bender has been busy stealing the many valuable artifacts from the city, and for the first time ever manages to fill up his chest cavity, and is even hauling a large sack around. When Fry, having escaped from the dungeon, begs him to help investigate what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden, even trying to tempt him with the possibility of more stuff to steal. Bender merely replies that, &quot;For the first time in my life, I feel like I've stolen enough...&quot; but Fry slaps him, and they head for the Forbidden Valley. They discover four identical castles, each more identical than the last and having statues of different aliens.\n\nBefore Leela can say, &quot;I do&quot;, Fry and the loot-stuffed Bender return with four women, each the last female of their species. Alcazar tries to reason with the women, shapeshifting each time to match their form; the women quickly beat him into submission, and he takes his real form, a green cockroach-like alien. He explains that he wanted to make it with five weirdos and have them scrub his five castles. Also, he explains that he had scheduled all five weddings on the same day, because it's very expensive to rent a tuxedo that can also change shape.\n\nLeela returns with the rest of the crew to [[Earth]], sadly contemplating her desire to find her species, wondering &quot;How many planets could there be?&quot; as she looks out at space.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\nIn this episode, the crew use their virtual reality equipment for the first time. This time they use it to access the Internet and play online video games. Leela becomes involved with Alcazar and almost marries him, although her relationship with him has little to do with love, and more to do with loneliness and a desire to propagate her species. Fry tries to talk Leela out of the relationship, but his motives are pure: rather than just selfishly trying to keep Leela for himself, he sees that Alcazar is bad for Leela and genuinely wants her to be happy.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bicyclops Built for Two, A}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

It originally aired in North America on April 9, 2000.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n[[Professor Farnsworth]] receives word from [[Mars University]] that they are revoking his professorship. When he arrives before the university's professors, he reveals all their secrets until he realizes it was his 150th birthday party. After everyone talks about how great he is, Farnsworth becomes concerned with his own mortality. He decides he needs to name a successor. The [[Planet Express crew]] expects one of them will be named, including [[Fry]], but Farnsworth reveals that his successor will be a 12-year old clone of himself, [[Cubert Farnsworth]].\n\nCubert decides that being an inventor is not an appealing career choice, and makes cutting remarks about the Professor and his inventions. A depressed professor makes a recording telling his crew that he has been lying about his age. He is actually 160, the age when robots from the [[Sunset Squad]] take people away, never to be seen again. Under cover of an overly-dramatic thunderstorm, a hooded robot arrives, and takes the Professor away while he was saying good-bye to every inanimate object around him.\n\nThe crew sets off to rescue the professor, and finds the [[Near Death Star]], the Sunset Squad's base of operations. The crew sneaks in with Fry dressed up as the professor with Cubert on his back posing as a hump to make him look 'old'. They even brought a huge jar of Cubert's blood just in case. They locate the professor, who is unconscious and hooked to a life-support system. They try to carefully disconnect him, only for the robots discover the crew, forcing them to rip him off, and they race back to the [[Planet Express ship]], Professor Farnsworth in tow.\n\nAs they reach the landing pad, Cubert is knocked unconscious, but they make it onto the ship in one piece. When the ship takes off, the [[robot]]s open fire, damaging the engines. Hoping the Professor would help fix them, they try everything to wake him up. A reawakened Cubert announces that he knows how to fix the engines, and the crew makes their escape. (The dark matter engines don't move the ship, but instead move the universe, allowing the ship to go faster than the speed of light.) Safely back on [[Earth]], Cubert tells the Professor that he has decided to follow in his footsteps. The Professor describes his experience on the Near Death Star, as he was hooked up to a virtual reality where he had to do everything an old person would do.\n\n== Debut Appearances ==\n*[[Cubert Farnsworth]]\n*[[Captain Muskie]]\n\n== Inventions and Gadgets ==\n*A time machine\n*A [[Universal Translator]], which can translate any language into, and ''only'' into, French, which is considered a dead language in the year [[3000]].\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nAnother sign of Hermes' personal issues with Zoidberg: while the employees argue over whom Farnsworth will name as heir, Hermes says, &quot;Up yours, Zoidberg.

He is a four-ton robot designed by The Friendly Robot Company, possibly a precursor to [[Mom's Friendly Robot Company]], in [[2801]] to judge whether people were naughty or nicе and sort out presents accordingly. Due to a programming error, his standards were set ''way'' too high, and Santa Bot invariably judges everyone naughty with the exception of [[Zoidberg]] at least once. Every year on [[Xmas]] Eve, Santa comes to [[Earth]] on his robot-reindeer sleigh to punish the naughty with extreme prejudice. It's said if someone is on the Naughty List, and Robot Santa finds him or her, he will chop his or her head off and stuff his or her neck holes with toys from his sack of horrors. Usually, though, he kills them using a variety of X-Mas-themed murder devices and heavy ordnance.\n\n[[File:Robotsantaonice.png|thumb|250px|left|Robot Santa Claus trapped in ice.]]\nWhen not on his Xmas mass murder spree, he spends most of the year in his death fortress at the North Pole of the planet [[Neptune]], where he watches the people of Earth doing naughty things on a series of giant monitors, ''1984''-style. A shantytown village named Jolly Junction lies at the base of his fortress, inhabited by unpaid, undersized, and underfed elf-dressed [[Neptunians]].\n\nRobot Santa Claus has proven quite resilient, having survived burning spaceship exhaust, explosions, and even survived listening to logical paradoxes - something which destroys other robots - thanks to &quot;paradox-absorbing crumple zones&quot; built into his head.\n\nRobot Santa Claus, though hostile to nearly everyone, apparently has a friendly acquaintances with [[Kwanzabot]] and the [[Chanuka Zombie]].\n\nWhen [[Nudist Alien Scammers]] gained possession of Earth, they also scammed Santa out of his Naughty List, leaving him unsure as to whom he should kill, so he joined forces with the [[Planet Express crew]] to retake the planet. \n\n== Behind the scenes ==\nSanta Bot was voiced by John Goodman in &quot;[[Xmas Story]]&quot; but in &quot;[[A Tale of Two Santas]]&quot; and ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'' he was voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* It is unknown how Robot Santa enacts surveillance upon the entire population of Earth but it is probable that he uses &quot;Mom's Old Fashioned Surveillance Unit&quot;.\n* Robot Santa was scammed out of his &quot;Naughtiness List&quot; in ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'' this made him quite upset because he wanted to cause discontent with the information on the List.\n* Robot Santa Claus has a bunch of [[Neptunian|Native Neptunians]] working in his workshop on Neptune but the [[Neptunians]] can be confused with Elves because they're underfed due to not turing a profit because Santa doesn't give them a paycheck.\n* He may have been inspired by the robot Santa seen in the Simpsons episode &quot;Homer's Phobia&quot;\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n* &quot;[[Xmas Story]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[A Tale of Two Santas]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Futurama Holiday Spectacular]]&quot;\n=== Films ===\n*''[[Bender's Big Score]]''\n\n== Quotes ==\n* &quot;I know he is but I have no choice.&quot; &quot;I'm already running late and if I don't complete my BRUTAL rampage well it just wouldn't be Xmas. - A Tale of Two Santas\n* &quot;Nice try but my head was built with paradox absorbing crumple zones&quot;. - A Tale of Two Santas.\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]"

However, Leela has begun to develop anger issues and upset about being insulted by [[Sal]], enters the ship in a [[Space Demolition Derby]], trashing the ship. As punishment, [[Leela]] is forced to wear a 50,000-volt shock collar that activates whenever she has a violent thought, uses profanity, has a sexual thought or lies.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Bender]] feels left out when he sees [[Cubert Farnsworth]] and [[Dwight Conrad]] playing [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]; he can't play because robots are not installed with imaginations. Trying as hard as he can, Bender manages to imagine himself as a medieval knight and joins the game, naming himself [[Titanius Anglesmith]]. However, since he was never meant to have an imagination, Bender gradually believes himself to be a real knight in the magical world of [[Cornwood]]. At first, he seems harmless, until he starts causing chaos everywhere. Eventually, he crashes into Leela's parents' house, where she has brought Zoidberg over to dinner to prove that she has resolved her anger issues, given that he is the one with the authority to remove the collar. Leela is unable to fight back with the collar on and Zoidberg is too scared to take it off. Fry manages to trick Bender into stopping by using a 'Cone of Coldness&quot; against him, which his character is vulnerable to. Bender is then brought to the [[Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots]].\n\n[[File:Titanius.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Titanius Angelsmith&quot;]]\n\nAfter watching [[Morbo]]'s interview with [[Mom]] on ''Tea with Titans'' on the controversy about the fuel shortage and how she's making record profits, the Professor reveals to the crew that when he worked for [[Mom]] for the third time after realizing she was evil twice before, he tried to make [[dark matter]] into a more durable harpsichord wax. Using a particle accelerator, he created a crystal that empowered dark matter, making it a usable fuel. But when he presented this to Mom, she took the crystal for herself. Mom fired Farnsworth and left him for [[Ogden Wernstrom]], her ex-husband. However, he also created an [[Anti-Backwards Crystal|anti-backwards crystal]], that, if brought within a six inch proximity to its sister crystal, could render dark matter useless again. Hermes points out that they would then have no fuel. Farnsworth says that once the universe is freed of Mom's dark matter grip, this would then compel scientists to create an alternative fuel. Unfortunately, he has forgotten where he had put it. Unknown to everyone, Dwight and Cubert have found it in the downstairs walrus tank and made it into a twelve-sided die for their game. Luckily, the Professor manages to activate a smell on the crystal that he can detect with his smelling aid, but Mom learns that the crystal still exists and sends her sons, [[Walt]], [[Larry]] and [[Ignar|Igner]] to take it back. Walt concocts a plan to enter the [[Planet Express]] headquarters with the three disguised as owl exterminators, and Fry lets them in. However, Farnsworth challenges them to actually ''exterminate'' an owl, Igner fouls up and they lose the crystal. Taking back his crystal, Farnsworth sends them back to Mom.\n\n[[File:OwlExterminators.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Owl Exterminators&quot;]]\n\nMeanwhile, [[Dr. Perceptron]] at Hal Institute tries to put Bender through all sorts of therapies, but nothing works. Therefore, the doctor decides to give him a robotomy, the robot equivalent of a lobotomy, to rid his mind of fantasy.\n\nFarnsworth, Leela and Fry infiltrate [[Mom's dark matter mine]], fooling the [[Killbots]] into thinking that they are flying the ship, which is actually on remote control. During their infiltration, it is discovered that Leela actually likes the shock from the collar. But they soon find that the mine is actually a farm, full of [[Nibblonian]]s and Leela's beloved [[Nibbler]], who was captured by Mom's sons. The Nibblonians are being force fed chickens and prune juice, which they can't help but to eat, so that they excrete dark matter. However, Nibbler is surprised that they aren't amazed that he can talk; Fry explains that he didn't erase their memories the last time and they kept him as a pet because he is cuter that way. Nibbler explains that exactly [[2972|36 years ago]], he was head of a Nibblonian outpost on [[Vergon 6]]. However, with all the dark matter they excreted into the planet, [[Democratic Order of Planets|DOOP]] began to mine the [[planet]], with the help of Mom. When the planet was sucked dry, Mom learned that Nibblonians produced dark matter and captured a ship full of them, except Nibbler, who was later kidnapped by Mom's sons when they were disguised as owl exterminators.\n\nSuddenly, Igner spots them, directing them up the &quot;primary chicken valve&quot; to Mom's office, having been compelled by the unexplained secret Mom told his brothers. They attempt to bring the two crystals together, but Mom brings up a gun. Farnsworth then swallows the anti-backwards crystal so she can't get her hands on it. However, she points out that he's in a harvesting plant and orders her sons to inject prune juice into him. Suddenly, all dark matter begins to resonate, especially the stockpile Bender has in his chest cavity. Suddenly, Bender disappears, just as he was about to undergo a robotomy and everyone at the mine feels the ice floor cave beneath their feet.\n\nFry and Leela then come out the ground somewhere, finding the anti-backwards crystal and discovering that Leela is now a centaur, Leegola. They meet Titanius Anglesmith and learn that they are in [[Cornwood]]. Titanius treats them to roasted [[munchkin]] and entertainment by dancing [[Dwarf|dwarves]] at his [[Titanius Anglesmith's castle|castle]] until [[Calculon]] rides up to warn them of danger. The crew ride out and attack [[Waltazar]], [[Larius]], and [[Ignus]]. The brothers are banished when [[Frydo]] accidentally rolls the anti-backwards crystal, or the [[Die of Power]] as they call it in Cornwood. Frydo and company meet [[the Great Wizard Greyfarn]], who tells them that [[Momon]] had created a set of dice from the living plastic in the [[Geysers of Gygax]]. Momon put too much of her power into the Die of Power and subsequently lost it. To defeat her, they must journey to her lands to destroy it in the lake of plastic.\n\n[[File:Wipecastle.jpg|thumb|left|Wipe Castle]]\n\nAs they begin their quest, they come upon a tribe of centaurs, led by the intersexual, pacifist [[Hermaphrodite]]. Leegola is excited that her people, as a group of well-trained archers, can defeat Momon's armies. However, the centaurs are opposed to fighting and try to refuse them passage through their territory. Leegola stands up to Hermaphrodite and takes his bow and arrows. The group arrives at the [[Cave of Hopelessness]], guarded by a huge ogre. [[Gynecaladriel]], queen of the water nymphos, joins their quest and seduces the ogre, putting him to sleep. As they enter the cave, they meet a large, centipede-esque creature, [[Zoidberg]], whom they presume to be the [[Tunneling Horror]]. Leegola brutally assaults him, eating his two hearts. Unfortunately, they learn that he is not the Tunneling Horror. Horrified that she had tried to kill an innocent creature, Leela runs off and joins the centaurs to learn their peaceful ways. Suddenly, the real Tunneling Horror arrives, but Frydo defeats it after rolling the die, causing him to grow. Greyfarn warns him not to be seduced by the die's power, but Frydo degenerates into a crawling [[Wikipedia:Gollum|Gollum-like]] creature, who is obsessed with the die and eventually runs off after a failed attempt to kill his friends. The crew decides to seek help at [[Wipe Castle]] in getting past Momon's armies, but the king, [[Roberto]], has sent his men out on a pointless suicide mission, forcing the crew to defend the castle themselves. Also, Momon had overheard them going to Wipe Castle before Frydo left them and sends Waltazar and Larius with all their armies to attack the castle, refusing to leave a small contingent behind.\n\nA declaration of war is announced and Leegola takes control of the centaur herd after beating up Hermaphrodite, refusing to participate in a tedious debate. She leads her armies to Wipe Castle, slaughtering Momon's legions. Gynecaladriel &quot;repays&quot; Leegola by making out with her. Just then, they notice two volcanoes erupting, meaning that Frydo is engaged in battle with Momon. However, Titanius suggests that they wait while watching Gynecaladriel and Leegola make out.\n\nFrydo, accompanied by the still living head of Zoidberg, arrives in Momon's lair. But he is too compelled by the power of the die to destroy it, so Zoidberg bites him. Momon becomes a dragon to get the die, but it grants Frydo &quot;Mirror Mania&quot;, allowing him to mimic her dragon form. While they battle, his friends arrive, who are descending along a fragile staircase, which Momon destroys. Ignus, riding a giant spider, which he thinks is a bug, urges them to hop on his mount. Greyfarn yells at him for his incompetence and duels Ignus in a lightstick fight. Ignus breaks it off, revealing that that he is in fact his son, which Greyfarn tries to deny, repeatedly hitting himself with his staff. Meanwhile, Frydo and Momon incapacitate each other when they hit the other's soft underbelly, reverting themselves to human form. Zoidberg then grabs the die. At first, he thinks to destroy it, but becomes corrupted by it. However, Momon seizes the die after Greyfarn squishes Zoidberg and all of Cornwood goes black, with the ground beneath everyone's feet collapsing.\n\nSuddenly, the crew and Mom and her sons end up back at the mine. The Professor explains that the dark matter resonance in Bender's chest, coupled with his imagination, created Cornwood. Unfortunately, Mom isn't interested in his explanations and orders Walt and Larry to once again inject prune juice into Farnsworth's stomach, where the anti-backwards crystal still is. However, Farnsworth asks for one last thing: a hug with his son, Igner. Igner has swallowed Mom's crystal and their hug effectively destroys the two crystals, rendering all dark matter useless. Farnsworth quickly comes up with an alternative fuel, known as &quot;nibbler power&quot;. Holding a chicken on a fishing pole just out of the Nibblonians reach, Farnsworth has them take the [[Planet Express ship]] and [[Planet Express crew|crew]] back home.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Billy West]] as [[Philip J.

If you look closely, you will see [[Petunia]], the [[Farmer|Moon Farmer]], and, oddly enough, '''[[Free Waterfall, Jr.]]''', who was eaten by [[Lrrr]] in &quot;[[The Problem with Popplers]].&quot;\n*When Fry is talking to the professor (currently talking through a monkey) about Bender playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons too much, the monkey is seen not holding anything, however later on, as Fry is walking and talking, the monkey is seen holding a Fry plushie, but when turned back around, he is empty handed again.\n*When Fry asks the professor why the cave is called &quot;The Cave of Hopelesness&quot;, his pupils disappear for a second.\n*When Titanius orders the day dance to be done, Leegola's top is white like Leela's tank top.\n*Leela says &quot;Sex and the City, that's funny&quot; and Amy nods along.\n*Netflix has this film listed second of the four. To view it in order them in the proper sequence, watch the &quot;Episode Numbers&quot; 1, 4, 2, 3.\n* According to the number of hits on a target marked: ''Celebrity Breakups,'' it happens a lot.\n\n== Continuity ==\n*Before Leela, Fry and the Professor enter Mom's dark matter mine, there are fan blades that the team must go through to enter the mine. The unwilling Fry says &quot;ladies first&quot; and Leela pushes Fry in. This same situation happened in ''[[I Second That Emotion]]'' when Fry was unwilling to enter the sewers.\n==Allusions==\n*The opening in the middle of the intro is a reference to the Beatles' 1968 animated music fantasy film ''[[wikipedia:Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', which is based on the Beatles' music and is named after their album 1966 single.\n*The title is a reference to the 1985 book ''[[wikipedia:Ender's Game|Ender's Game]]'' by [[wikipedia:Orson Scott Card|Orson Scott Card]].\n*A [[wikipedia:Lego|LEGO]] car appears in the race.\n*The boys play the famous game ''[[wikipedia:Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.\n*When Mom and Professor Farnsworth model  the molecule diagram. It is a reference to a scene in the 1990 film, ''[[wikipedia:Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', where the characters Molly and Sam are forming clay and the 1955 song ''[[wikipedia:Unchained Melody|Unchained Melody]]&quot; by [[wikipedia:The Righteous Brothers|The Righteous Brothers]] plays in the background of the romantic scene.''\n*One of the robots in Bender's group therapy is a reference to the Hatter from the 1865 story ''Alice in Wonderland'' as well what he always does in the story: changing places. One of the other characters is a teapot - from which the Hatter drinks.*Dr. Perceptron says, &quot;Stop! Hammer time!&quot; This is a lyric from rapper, MC Hammer, and his own reality show called ''Hammerman''.\n*When Professor Farnsworth removes Igner, Walt and Larry's masks, it is reminiscent of the end of each ''Scooby-Doo'' episode, where the gang take the masks off the criminal who is behind the mask.\n*When the Professor, Fry, and Leela are on the way toward the mine, the camera angles, sound and visual effects of the elevator descending scene is reminsicent of the moving rooms in the 1997 film '[[wikipedia:Cube (film)|CUBE]]''.''\n*Nibbler explains the occurrence of robot slavery in the old days by saying:  ''&quot;Remember this was before Robot Lincoln&quot;. ''Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States of America's and the one to end the slavery. Robot Lincoln was then the robot who gave the freedom back to the robots.\n*There are many references to ''Lord of the Rings'':\n**The crystal that empowered dark matter is on the top of a pointy tower, which is a reference to the Eye of Sauron.\n**Fry and Leela are now Frydo and Leegola, a reference to the characters in the'' Lord of the Rings'', Frodo and Legolas. And as the story progresses, Frydo begins to take more and more interest in the crystal, as Frodo did with the ring. Frydo begins to look like Sméagol and begins to get two personalities. This includes a parody of a scene from ''The'' ''Two Towers'', where Sméagol converses with a reflection of himself in the water. Leegola is as skilled with a bow and an arrow as Legolas. \n**Leela asks ''&quot;Is that a hobbit?&quot;.''\n**Momon's Sons Three look like three Nazgûls.\n**Frydo like Frodo gets wounded by a sword.\n**The map of the realm looks like the map of Middle Earth from ''The Hobbit'' and the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy.\n**Bender tries to destroy the crystal with force, just as Gimli tried to destroy the ring with force.\n**The crystal is made in Geysers of Gygax and can only be destroyed there; the One Ring from the ''Lord of the Rings'' was made in Mount Doom and can also only be destroyed there.\n**The Geysers of Gygax are also a reference to Gary Gygax, one of the co-creators of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\n**Professor Farnsworth is now Grayfarn, a reference to Gandalf the Grey.\n**The scene where Greyfarn is studying the anti-backwards crystal by the fireside is a reference to Gandalf studying the One Ring by the fireside in ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.\n**Hermaphrodite says &quot;...you may pass.&quot; This is likely a reference to when Gandalf the Grey says: ''&quot;You cannot pass! You shall not pass!&quot;'' in ''Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring'' when he tried to stop the Balrog.\n**The movie features an ice mountain, just as in ''The Fellowship of the Ring''. The episode also features a walking, talking tree, a reference to Treebeard and the Ents in ''The Two Towers''.\n**The Cave of Hopelessness is a reference to the Mines of Moria.\n**The Morcs are a reference to Orcs, as well as to the television series, ''Mork and Mindy''.\n**Zoidberg offers to carry Frydo, as Sam did with Frodo but Frydo says no.\n**A big spider is featured, which is reminiscent of Sheilob.\n** The battle of Wipe Castle is reminsicent of the battle of Minas Tirith.\n** The centaurs' arrow relay resembles the beacon of Minas Tirith.\n**Momon's destruction of the staircase is reminiscent of the stairs collapsing in Moria in ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.\n*The fight between The Great Wizard Greyfarn and Ignus is a reversed parody of the fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.\n*Fry states that &quot;It's all come down to this: a dungeon and dragons.&quot; This is a clear reference to the game, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.\n*The Game ends by Momon saying: &quot;GAME OVER&quot;\n*Item # 1101-1816 Knife Show is a parody of a katana accident on the Home Shpping Network\n\n==Goofs==\nIn &quot;Mother's day it is revealed that it was the professor who dumped Mom because she turned evil, but in this episode it is Mom who dumps the professor because she is getting back with her ex-husband Professor Wermstrom. This might have been the last dump, Because Farnsworth says he broke up with her 3 times.\n\n==Alienese==\n*&quot;OBEY MOM&quot; is written in [[Alienese|Alienese.]]\n==Videos==\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;300&quot; columns=&quot;2&quot; position=&quot;center&quot; hideaddbutton=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\nFUTURAMA BENDER'S GAME\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n== Debut Appearances ==\n*[[Gynecaladriel]]\n*[[Titanius Anglesmith]]\n*[[The Dixie Chicks]]\n*[[The Great Wizard Greyfarn]]\n*[[Jeremy]]\n*[[Peaches]]\n*[[Swamp Hag]]\n*[[Treedledum]]\n*[[Tunneling Horror]]\n*[[Roberto|King Roberto]]\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Character Arcs===\n* Sal's speech impediment seems practically to be in remission. His pluralizing is much subdued from previous episodes. Unfortunately, his disorder seems to rub off on Leela occasionally, as it does in their conversation at the Mombil gas station. During the demolition derby, [[Hoschel]] shows that he too is affected by Sal's disease.\n* Farnsworth pronounces the words &quot;warning&quot;, &quot;wave&quot;, &quot;Walt&quot;, &quot;we're&quot;, &quot;waistband&quot; with a &quot;wh&quot;.\n\n===Identity===\n* Leela's [[Wrist LoJack-a-mater]] serves as a speed-pass (which electronically pays for her dark matter purchase) and later as a two-way radio.\n* The head of Rich Little, as usual, impersonates Howard Cosell.\n* The Dixie Chicks appear as a single, hideous organism that resulted from an earlier matter-transport accident. Later, Rich Little is absorbed into the Chicks' &quot;hideous conglomeration&quot;.\n* Bender becomes Titanius Englesmith, and of course there are alter-egos for many of the other characters in the &quot;real&quot; universe.\n* Farnsworth transfers his mind into a monkey.\n\n===The Scary Door===\nLeela and Hermes watch the Scary Door episode in which the narrator speaks with food in his mouth. Aliens invade Earth but are eradicated by dinosaurs.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nTuranga Munda encourages Leela to consider Zoidberg as a dating candidate.\n\n===Farnsworth and Mom===\nIn Farnsworth's tale recounting his accidental invention of dark matter, we learn of Mom &quot;getting back together with my ex-husband&quot;, Wernstrom. It is also revealed that Igner is the love child of Farnsworth and Mom.\n\n===Nibbler===\nNibbler's &quot;secret&quot; identity was revealed in [[Bender's Big Score]], but no one talked about it. It was never mentioned in [[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]. It finally comes up here, when Fry, Leela, and Farnsworth discover Mom's &quot;crap farm&quot;. Strangely, Nibbler has forgotten that he hadn't wiped out everyone's memory at the end of Bender's Big Score. He expresses surprise at their lack of surprise, and they have to remind him that he had forgotten to erase their memory. He is very embarrassed on hearing this news; he had been living with them all this time, not only behaving as a house pet, but also being treated as a house pet rather than an equal.\n\nNibbler explains that he had been stationed at a scientific outpost on Vergon 6, and that he had only by chance escaped capture when Mom kidnapped his colleagues for her crap farm.\n\n===Injury, Death===\n* [[Morbo]] is devoured by [[Lrrr]], who is devoured by [[H. G. Blob]], who is devoured by the [[Slurm Queen]], who is devoured by [[Nibbler]].\n* Fry, Leela, and Bender are thrown across the bridge of the Planet Express ship when it runs out of fuel.\n* The dark matter purchase at the Mombil gas station involves a painful shock to Leela's right forearm.\n* Leela and some of the Planet Express crew participate in a demolition derby, with a predictable compliment of related injuries and deaths.\n* Zoidberg surgically opens Farnsworth's abdominal cavity and removes several organs in order to return the ship keys to Farnsworth's stomach.\n* Farnsworth fits Leela with a 50,000-volt shock collar, which shocks her whenever her thoughts &quot;turn to violence, profanity, or perversions of a sexual nature.&quot; The collar shocks her quite often throughout much of the episode.\n* Leela uses her shock collar to administer a lengthy shock to Bender and Zoidberg.\n* A ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' devours a conquering alien.\n* Nibbler eats several chickens \n* Bender leaps out the window of a multi-story building and falls to the ground. He is then run over by a hover-bus.\n* Bender beats Zoidberg with a trash-can lid and shoots him in the head with a metal spoon from a makeshift bow-and-arrow.\n* Bender spends some time in the robot mental hospital, in which countless robot injuries and robot deaths occur.\n* A random rabbit is devoured by a random polar bear.\n* The usual slapping and stooge-style battery take place among Mom and her sons throughout.\n* Farnsworth, Mom, and her two eldest infant sons are hurled across the room by an explosion of dark matter.\n* Farnsworth is fired from his job at MomCorp in the normal fashion, involving a giant hydraulic piston knocking him bodily through a wall and out of the multi-story building.\n* The appearance of killbots throughout results in the usual deaths of killbots.\n* Leela destroys a robot elevator operator with a karate kick.\n* Fry, Leela, and Farnsworth are thrown to the floor of a falling elevator.\n* The combat-heavy D&amp;D theme of the episode makes for countless injuries and deaths throughout. Leela even discovers a temporary love of causing injury and death.\n\n===&lt;nowiki/&gt;===\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n[[Category:Movies]]\n[[Category:Season 5]]"

It was thought to be the last episode of the series, until [[Comedy Central]] announced the series would be revived with new episodes starting on June 24, 2010.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn deepest space, a wave of green energy animates a small system in slightly deepest space, causing DNA to form.\n\n[[File:Hutch Waterfall.png|thumb|right|Hutch Waterfall]]\nThe scene switches to [[Mars Vegas]], which is promptly demolished and [[New Mars Vegas]] is being constructed. [[Leo Wong]] has no interest in what he destroys, like an oasis, or the [[Marian Muck Leech|Martian Muck Leech]]es. [[Leela]] is only able to save one, which repeatedly sucks blood from her, before [[Leo]] covers the rest of its colony with cement. During a protest from the [[Eco-Feministas]], led by [[Frida Waterfall]], Leo blows up the ground beneath their feet, causing Frida's femi-necklace to lodge itself in [[Philip J. Fry|Fry's]] head, hidden by his &quot;hair horn&quot;. Leo compromises by giving Fry a token to a free poker tournament and the rest of the crew a free vacation. Soon enough, Fry seems to know what everyone else is thinking or going to say next. He leaves the casino, only to be overwhelmed by a number of voices in his head. He runs into an alley, where he meets a transient named [[Hutch Waterfall|Hutch]], who gives him a tinfoil hat to place over his head to block out the voices. However, Hutch discovers that he can't read Fry's mind. He warns Fry not to tell anyone or else [[the Dark One]]s will get him easily.\n\n[[File:Fanny.jpg|thumb|left|I'm Bender, let's do it.]]\nBender falls in love with [[Fanny]], a [[Fembot]] married to [[Donbot]], head of the Robot Mafia. They have an affair when the Donbot isn't looking. However, his cohorts, [[Joey Mousepad]] and [[Clamps]] grow suspicious. Deciding to do something good with his telepathy, Fry enters a poker tournament with use of the chip Leo gave him and all of his life savings. [[Bender]] enters also, using Fanny's bra, instead of running before the Donbot gets wise. Fry manages to get to the finals with his telepathy. However, Bender wins by dumb luck, especially since Fanny gave him the Donbot's lucky foot. Finally, suspicious, the Donbot and his gang take Bender and Fanny out into the Martian Desert, where they shoot and bury them. But since, as robots, they couldn't truly be killed, they emerge from the ground next day. They breakup the affair and Franny goes back to the Donbot.\n\nWhile surveying a system with a [[Violet Dwarf Star]], the [[Planet Express crew]] locates primordial lifeforms on an asteroid but the Professor, having been bribed by Leo, decides to demolish the system anyway.\n\n[[File:800px-Legionofmadfellows.jpg|thumb|right|The Legion of Mad Fellows]]\nFry meets Hutch again, who knocks him out and drags him down into a secret lair beneath a dumpster and is introduced to the [[Legion of Mad Fellows]], a group of telepaths who are trying to stop evil forces from destroying the gateway to the &quot;green age&quot;. Their leader, the [[Number 9 Man]], explains that the energy force called Chi gave life to the universe. However, it receded, causing the majority of the universe's species to go extinct. He tells Fry to go undercover as Leo's security guard and make sure that he does not destroy the violet dwarf.\n\n[[Leo Wong]] goes to demolish an arm of the [[Milky Way]] for a [[Leo Wong's &quot;Miniature&quot; Golf Course|&quot;miniature&quot; golf course]], prompting Leela, [[Amy]] and [[LaBarbara]] to join the Eco-Feministas. Unfortunately, during a peaceful protest, an golf cart accidentally kills the [[Headless Body of Spiro Agnew]]. Forced on the run from the government and [[Zapp Brannigan]], Leela proposes that they take more direct action. After sabotaging many of Leo's construction sites, they gain support from [[Earth]]'s female populace. They even hijack the [[Planet Express ship]] and paint it pink, locking the [[Professor]], [[Hermes]] and [[Zoidberg]], who were hired by Leo to build a fence, in a go-go cage. They then locked Leo in his own fence.\n\nWhile on duty, Fry discovers Frida attempting to hammer down another terrible slogan on Leo's property. He manages to tell her to pass on a message to inform Leela that he's trying to save the violet dwarf too. But when she mentally reminds herself back at the Honeybun Hideout, the Dark One hears her and demands to know who gave her the message. Luckily, she didn't know Fry's name, but unluckily, she is psychically murdered. With her dying breath, she pleads her long-lost brother to avenge her death.\n\nAt the second meeting with the Legion, in the old Martian reserve that was abandoned five years ago (as seen on ''[[Where the Buggalo Roam]]''), Number 9 explains to Fry about the ongoing battle between the [[Encyclopod]]s, a race who seeks the preservation of all life and the Dark Ones, who desire destruction of all species, who had since evolved from a frog and snake living in symbiotic harmony. When the [[Chi]] receded, only the strongest could survive, like the Dark Ones, while a significant amount of life was extinguishing, like the Encyclopods. But they believe that they left an egg behind, which is the violet dwarf star. Once the Encyclopods are reborn, they can recreate all the species that ever went extinct. However, Fry can't tell anyone about this, as the Dark Ones will know of the Legion's existence and kill anyone who knows about the egg.\n[[File:Dixie and Trixie.png|thumb|left|Dixie and Trixie help Bender dress as a distracting hooker]]\nThe feministas return to the [[Honeybun Hideout]], coincidentally next door to the reserve, to find Frida murdered. Having heard from [[Amy]] that Fry is working for her father, they all fear that he killed her. Leela calls Fry to prove them wrong, but when he mentions Frida, she fears that he killed her. However, they agree to meet at [[Keeler Canyon]]. Unfortunately, Zapp was eavesdropping on their conversation, due to Bender bugging Fry's phone, and ambushes them. Thinking him a traitor, Leela takes Fry hostage. Eventually, after a chase around the miniature golf course, the Feministas are captured, put on trial, sentenced and sent to [[jail]]. However, the Dark One telepathically urges Leela to escape. Leela's initial plan was to have to the Martian muck leech tunnel their way to freedom but the hole it digs is too small and takes too long. Bender soon breaks them out, stating that he'd be committing fifteen felonies at the same time. However, breaking out was even more difficult, as security was tight. After a failed plan to distract the guards with Bender as a hooker, they decide to run for it, as Bender bends a brick wall. Once outside, they are evacuated by the rest of the [[Planet Express Crew|Planet Express crew]].\n\nAt his third meeting with the Legion, Fry is given the mysterious [[Omega device]] to momentarily disable the Dark One at close range. The only problem is knowing who and what the Dark One looks like after eons of evolution and the fact that his mind is unreadable. Worse, the Dark One can sense their thoughts, even through their tinfoil hats, therefore, they can't come up with a plan. [[Number 9 Man|Number 9&amp;nbsp;Man]] trusts Fry, whose [[The Why of Fry|lack]] of a [[Delta Brainwave]] renders his mind unreadable, to find and stop the Dark One.\n\nAt the ceremony, Fry is given the honor to blow up the violet dwarf star, while scanning the crowd for the Dark One. Unfortunately, he is unable to even detect the Dark One's presence and concludes that since his mind can't be read, he must be the Dark One. Just then, the Planet Express crew arrives and takes the detonator. The Dark One telepathically urges Leo to blow up the star, but is disabled by a swing of a golf club from Amy. As Leela is about to defuse the detonator, Fry urges her to give it back to him, though he is unable to explain his intentions; after a moment of reflection, Leela decides to trust him and gives it back. Fry pushes the trigger anyway, having rewired it to the Omega device, intending to destroy himself. However, the device extends into a more complex mechanism, and an orb of green light briefly engulfs Fry and Leela. Dumbfounded that he was still alive, Fry yells, ''&quot;It didn't work. I'm the Dark One and it didn't do anything!&quot;'' Just then, the Dark One reveals himself as the Martian muck leech, who is affected by the device.\n\n[[File:FryandLeelakiss.jpg|thumb|right|Fry and Leela share a kiss]]\nThe asteroids in the system form a sperm-like shape and go into the violet dwarf, triggering the birth of a massive Encyclopod that looks like a manta ray with a biodome on its back, containing countless alien species and plants. As Hutch is about to explain everything, the Dark One attacks him by the throat. Fry slaps away the evil creature. Hutch notices Frida's necklace, who is his sister, lodged in Fry's brain and takes it out, thus ridding Fry of his mind-reading abilities, before expiring. Vowing to avenge Hutch, the Encyclopod then destroys the leech and its corpse is eaten by the always-hungry Zoidberg before its DNA could be preserved. The Encyclopod preserves Hutch's DNA before leaving, ignoring Fry's insistence that humanity is not an endangered species. Zapp tries to arrest the Planet Express crew again for fifty-three counts of &quot;fugivity&quot; and they all flee in the ship, with Kif going along with them. While escaping the ''[[Nimbus]]'', they decide to fly into a wormhole, not knowing the destination. Fry and Leela say that they love each other; they kiss as the crew flies into the wormhole. In [[Rebirth]] you find out where the wormhole takes them.\n\n== Continuity Issues ==\n*Nixon says, &quot;I did stage the moon landing... on Venus!&quot;, but Fry and Leela find the [[Moon|lunar]] landing site on the [[moon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Series Has Landed]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was moved to the moon by a group called the &quot;Historical Sticklers Society&quot;. Though this was used as a way to explain the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Module#Lunar_Module_specifications Lunar Ascension Module]'s appearance and it is a valid explanation as to how the lander may have been found on the moon, it is not an explanation for the foot prints found outside the lander. He also references finding nothing on the moon except for the revolting Onion people in the [[Beast With a Billion Backs]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n*The song about Mars Vegas at the beginning of the movie was sung by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane Seth MacFarlane]\n*We have seen the &quot;Dark One&quot; before.  His first appearence was &quot;The Tunnelling Horror&quot;  in Bender's Game during which he is shrunk to his current size.  Two characters remembered him.  [[Leela]] must have realized he used to be the tunneling horror which is why she snuck him into the prison and attempted to use him to tunnel the feminista's out. Zoidberg hated the tunneling horror in Bender's Game which explains why he was so anxious to eat it throughout the Wild Green Yonder.\n* The demonstrations sing the begging of one of United States' most famous songs from 1940 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Land_Is_Your_Land &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot;]\n*Every character living in the Futurama series appears in this film besides &quot;[[Old Man Waterfall]]&quot;.\n*Botany Bay, a hotel in New Mars Vegas, is a reference to the real [[Wikipedia:Mandalay Bay|Mandalay Bay]] and also the ship aboard which Khan escaped Earth in ''[[Star Trek]]: The Original Series'' episode [[Wikipedia:Space Seed|Space Seed]]. Also, Khan and his followers use the SS ''Botany Bay'' as a shelter on Ceti Alpha V in [[Wikipedia:Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan|Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan]].\n*All the main characters, except [[Cubert Farnsworth]] and [[Dwight Conrad]] are on board the Planet Express Ship at the end.\n*The sandworms on [[Mars]] are similar to the sandworms from the books and films, [[Wikipedia:Dune|Dune]].\n*The co-ordinates Zapp gives to find Leela, 36,24,36, are the same as [[w:c:Simpsons:Bart Simpson|Bart Simpson's]] locker code, as well as being the measurements for an hourglass figure.\n*Number 9 can be seen in many episodes incognito.\n*When searching for existence of life near the [[Violet Dwarf Star]], [[Bender]] is using the same scope that Spock uses in regular episodes of ''Star Trek''.\n*This film aired in 4 parts from 3 July to 6 July 2010 on Sky1 in the UK.\n*The prison where the Feministas go to serve out their sentence contains a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon Panopticon] . Its architect, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham Jeremy Bentham], declared it &quot;a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind.&quot;\n*The green energy shown in the movie could be the time traveling sphere from Bender's Big Game\n\n== Background Information ==\n*According to [[David X. Cohen]], the movie has a &quot;real epic sci-fi story that involves this ancient battle that's been going on for billions of years and our crew, of course, ends up in the middle of that. It ends on a real sweet note and we'll be content with that if it's the last we ever do.&quot;\n\n== Goofs ==\n*Leela's parents are seen in the audience outside the Violet Dwarf System, although they may have gotten a pass to come to the surface.\n*[[Morbo]]'s statement was wrong: a child was in fact there, [[Cubert Farnsworth]].\n*When the main characters enter the [[Planet Express ship]], Leela is wearing her feminista outfit and Fry is wearing a formal uniform;, but once inside, they can be seen in their classic outfits - this was most likely intentional, however; assuming this was the last episode/movie of Futurama, the creators probably ended it with all the characters in their original outfits, although [[LaBarbara Conrad]] still had her Feminista outfit on.\n*When Hutch Waterfall was killed by the leech, he is still there with the other minor characters.\n*When saving the Martian Muck Leech, Leela steps on it 4 times, yet when she looks to pick it up, there are 5 bootprints.\n*When the Eco-Feministas destroy the device Leo Wong is using to destroy Saturn's rings by shoving a potato in the tailpipe, Leo claims he can smell potatoes, and yet he's wearing a helmet, and the particles can't travel through airless space.\n**If this were true, however, the Professor's Smell-o-scope would be completely useless as Cubert first suggested.\n*When the feministas are arrested by Bender, he says that he weighs 2 tons, which is about 4000 pounds, even though he weighs only 525 pounds.\n*When Leela and the Eco-Feministas trap the Wongs with their electric fence, Frida Waterfall can be seen standing behind Leela in the ship. Leela then states that their chief slogan-writer (Frida Waterfall) is back at the honeybun hideout, despite also being on board.\n*When the [[Hubert J.Farnsworth|Professor]] says &quot;Money talks&quot; and holds up a bill, there's a close-up of the bill talking. However, the hand that's holding it belongs to [[Hermes]]. When the close-up ends, it's the Professor holding the bill.\n\n==Videos==\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;300&quot; columns=&quot;2&quot; position=&quot;center&quot; hideaddbutton=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\nFuturama Into The Wild Green Yonder\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n== Status ==\nOn June 9, 2009, it was confirmed that [[Comedy Central]] picked up the show for 26 new episodes that will begin airing in 2010, spread over two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/06/its-official-futurama-returns.html&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Alienese ==\n*The two signs in [[Alienese]] read, &quot;Caution: Falling Humans&quot; and &quot;The Humans Shall Not Defeat Us&quot;.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Character Arcs===\nFarnsworth pronounces &quot;Wong&quot; with a &quot;wh&quot;.\n\n===Identity===\nLeela's Wrist LoJack-a-mater serves as a ray gun to kill, or at least disable, a muck leech; it's possible that this is not a new feature, as it could simply be the emergency face-laser that she used on Fry in Spanish Fry.\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nEndowed with psychic power, Fry &quot;hears&quot; Hermes thinking that Zoidberg is &quot;pathetic but lovable&quot;.

[[Comedy Central]] aired the movie as a &quot;four-part epic&quot; on October 19, 2008. The movie has been nominated for an Annie Award, under the &quot;Best Animated Home Entertainment&quot; category.\n\nGuest voices include [[David Cross]], [[Brittany Murphy]], Professor [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Dan Castellaneta]] reprising his role as [[Robot Devil|The Robot Devil]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a month of inactivity following the universe being ripped open, people decide to go on with their lives. [[Amy]] and [[Kif]] get married on [[Amphibios 9]], and [[Fry]] starts a new relationship with [[Colleen]]; this upsets [[Bender]], since Fry is spending more time with Colleen than with him. Fry decides to move in with Colleen, despite his discovery that she has four additional boyfriends living with her. After his hectic first evening at Colleen's apartment where she reveals she is going on a date with a 6th boyfriend, Fry is unable to accept that she cannot settle for one man and breaks up with her.\n\nAt a scientific conference, [[Professor Farnsworth]] proposes an expedition to investigate the [[anomaly]], and beats his arch-rival [[Wernstrom]] in a game of [[Deathball]], winning the right to mount the expedition. When Bender is sent to explore the anomaly, like a tool, much to his dismay, his touch causes the anomaly to emit a shockwave which sends the [[Planet Express ship]] flying. Farnsworth and Wernstrom discover that only living beings can pass through the anomaly unaffected; electrical objects such as robots are either repelled or destroyed. The two team up to try and initiate another expedition, but their idea is rejected in favor of a military assault on the anomaly led by [[Zapp Brannigan]] in the [[Nimbus]].\n\nMeanwhile, both Fry and Bender begin to feel alone, unwanted, and miserable. Fry, in his despair, sneaks aboard Zapp's ship just before it takes off so that he can find solace on the other side of the anomaly; Bender, on the other hand, is approached by the fabled [[League of Robots]], a secret society of robots who like to blather about and tease humans, led by his hero [[Calculon]]. Bender quickly becomes a very prestigious member due to his perceived hatred of humans and &quot;applying the law with no regard for its intent&quot;, although Calculon suspects that he is not as hard-hearted towards humans as he leads them to believe. However, Bender is very much dismayed when he learns that the League has no intention of killing all humans.\n\nAs Fry enters the anomaly, Zapp's plan of attack using a weapon called a [[Universe to Universe Missile]] or UUM goes awry, and Kif is accidentally killed by Zapp in the process, much to Amy's grief. While drifting through space on the other side of the anomaly, which contains another universe, Fry comes across a colossal, one-eyed, tentacled creature, which begins forcing its appendages through the anomaly. The tentacles begin to attack everyone in the universe, and nothing, not even [[diamondillium]] or [[diamondium]] can stop the tentacles since they are made of electro-matter that can only be harmed by other electro-matter, rendering the them completely invulnerable. Fry returns to Earth with a tentacle attached to the back of his neck and tells everyone to &quot;love the tentacle.&quot; The tentacles begin to attach themselves to everyone, causing their victims to fall in love with it. With the monster's influence spreading quickly, Fry becomes the pope of a new religion established to worship the tentacles. The [[Planet Express crew]] take shelter in their [[Planet Express building|office building]] but Zoidberg, Farnsworth, Scruffy, Wormstrum, and Hermes eventually all get caught by the tentacles, leading Leela and Amy to escape on Amy's [[party board]] and eventually meet up with Zapp.\n\nBender, meanwhile, believes that the League of Robots should uphold a strict no-humans policy as he feels so insignificant around them. However, when he assists his friends in eluding the tentacles, he is caught red-handed by the other members. When Calculon calls his bluff about hating humans, he challenges Calculon to a duel using weapons called [[Planetary Annihilator]]s. Bender cheats, damaging Calculon's arm and destroying part of their headquarters. Calculon is outraged by his behavior but, instead of kicking the indifferent Bender out of the League as initially implied, he resigns from the League himself and names Bender its new leader.\n\nAfter Zapp and Amy sleep with each other and get stuck with tentacles, [[Leela]] ends up being the last living person in the universe unattached to a tentacle. She examines a fragment of tentacle that snapped off trying to catch her and discovers that the tentacles are actually reproductive organs, known as genticles, which meant that Yivo was performing rape on everyone in the universe. She reveals this to everyone at a universal religious gathering. The creature, [[Yivo]], admits that mating with everyone in the universe was its original intention, but explains that it is now truly in love with them. As a sign of good faith and to prove himself trustworthy to everyone, Yivo resurrects Kif, who is displeased to learn that Zapp had tricked the then-grieving Amy into sleeping with him. Yivo asks to begin the relationship anew and removes its tentacles from everyone.\n\nYivo takes everyone in the universe out on a date all at the same time, which goes extremely well. However, the universe's leaders feel that Yivo has made no actual commitment and sends a delegation to break up with it. Before they can do so, however, Yivo proposes marriage and they accept. During this time, Bender is fed up with being neglected by Fry and makes a deal with the [[Robot Devil]] to trade his [[Bender's firstborn son|firstborn son]] for an [[Army of the Damned]] from [[Robot Hell]] in order to take over the world and rebuild his human-hating reputation in the League. However, before Bender can attack, humanity willingly leaves Earth to live on Yivo, along with the other civilizations of the universe, moving onto Yivo's body via golden escalators. This leaves Bender lonely once more and stagnates the robot population, who are built to serve humans. As the robots inherit Earth, everyone else is made to promise never to make contact with other universes. Fry, however, cannot help but secretly write a letter to Bender back on Earth. Leela does not trust Yivo's motives at first, but when she sees that everyone is happy with it, she eventually succumbs to her own loneliness and comes to accept Yivo.\n\n\nBender receives Fry's letter, which is made out of [[electro matter]], and decides to set out and &quot;[[Robot Invasion of Heaven|rescue]]&quot; his friend from his relationship with Yivo. He and his army harpoon Yivo from beyond the anomaly and drag it into their own universe where they are able to attack it. Fry convinces Bender to spare Yivo, but Yivo discovers that the robots' weapons are lined with the electro-matter from Fry's letter, allowing them to harm it. Since Fry broke his promise to never make contact with any other universes, Yivo breaks up with not only Fry but the entire universe with the exception of Colleen. While everyone leaves aboard Bender's ship, Yivo finds consolation with Colleen, making Fry feel betrayed, and they begin a single relationship as they head back to the other universe together and close the anomaly forever.\n\nEveryone laments that they will never know happiness or love with Yivo again; Fry decides to find love elsewhere and tries to ask Leela out, but she rejects him since he had already stopped trying once he met Colleen; Kif and Amy's relationship is strained due to Amy's alleged &quot;affair&quot; with Zapp, whom Kif punches hard in the gut for rubbing it in; and Farnsworth and Wernstrom go back to being arch rivals. Bender breaks up his friends' quarrel and assures them that what they experienced was not love, as love is a jealous, hard-to-get emotion that does not share itself with the world. Bender shares his own love with Fry and Leela by giving them a big hug which, in turn, actually strangles them.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The title of the movie ''&quot;The Beast with a Billion Backs&quot; '' references the 1955 horror movie ''[[wikipedia:The Beast with a Million Eyes|The Beast with a Million Eyes]]'' and &quot;the beast with two backs&quot;, a metaphor for sexual intercourse coined by Willam Shakespeare in &quot;Othello&quot;.\n**This reference has also been made in the episode [[Spanish Fry]], where an erotic shop that the crew visited was named &quot;''The Beast with Two Bucks''&quot;.\n*When Fry deleted Yivo's contact on his cell phone, [[Scruffy]] the janitor's name can be seen on his list. This is a display of irony since throughout the series, almost no one could remember Scruffy's name or why he was there in the first place.\n*Fry takes Colleen to a carnival celebrating ''St. [[Wikipedia:Issac Asimov|Asimov's]] Day''.\n*Deathball resembles the game [[Wikipedia:Labyrinth (game)|Labyrinth]].\n*Fry called &quot;DIAL-A-JOKE&quot; from Colleen's apartment 8128 times.\n*Yivo is able to mate with [[Decapodians]] without killing them.\n*Red Minotaur is a reference to the energy drink Red Bull.\n*Pink Floyd's 'The Dark Side of the Moon' album cover is shown upside down on the prison sign.\n* When [[Yivo]]`s tentacles are having dates with all people, &quot;[[wikipedia:I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi (I Like You Very Much)|I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi (I Like You Very Much)]]&quot; by [[Wikipedia:Carmen Miranda|Carmen Miranda]] is played.\n** The scene where [[Zoidberg]] is eating [[Wikipedia:Spaghetti|spaghetti]] with one of the tentacles is a parody of the scene from [[Wikipedia:Lady and the Tramp|Lady and the Tramp]] film.\n*Bender's speech about love is a parody of 1 Corinthians 13:4, &quot;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.&quot;\n*Bender's Army of the Damned are actually parodies of the Gungans in ''Star Wars: The Phantom Menace''.\n*On the audio commentary, [[David X. Cohen]] confirms that the title refers to the phrase for sexual intercourse, &quot;the beast with two backs&quot;, which originated in Shakespeare's Othello.\n*When Bender fights Yivo's mouth, it is a reference to a pirate fighting the Kraken. Maybe it is a reference to the ''[[wikipedia:Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', where [[wikipedia:Captain Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]]'s foot is locked and the [[wikipedia:Kraken|Kraken]] is about to eat and swallow him. Bender also loses his left foot and has to go around like it is a wooden leg, which many pirates have in many different stories and fairytales.\n*In this episode, The character called That guy appeared in this episode maybe as a goof\n*Zapp Brannigan calls 3008 the year of the Tiger. It is actually going to be the year of the Dragon.\n*In the Deathball match Farnsworth uses a ball to break the glass and knock Wornstrom into one of the holes scoring a point.  We than zoom out to see no damage and Wornstrom back in his place.\n\n==Videos==\n&lt;gallery widths=&quot;300&quot; columns=&quot;2&quot; position=&quot;center&quot; hideaddbutton=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\nFuturama The Beast With A Billion Backs\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n== Memorable Quotes ==\n'''Fry:''' Bender, why did you do it?

Fry begins the episode dating Colleen, and Leela makes no comment when the two women meet. However, when Zoidberg barfs for joy, Leela agrees that the way Fry and Colleen behave toward each other is &quot;pretty sickening&quot;. It could be that Leela harbors a bit of jealousy.\n\nTo Fry's credit, he doesn't immediately go slobbering after Leela when he breaks up with Colleen. He pines for a while, even going to counseling (which Leela would appreciate for its contribution to Fry's maturity) and finally decides to leave this universe. Leela practically encourages him in this endeavor. On meeting Yivo, Fry falls in love with shkler. Leela is suspicious for a long time, but she also eventually falls in love with Yivo.\n\nAfter being &quot;rescued&quot; by Bender, Fry sheds a tear on saying goodbye to Yivo. For a brief moment he seems sincere, but immediately turns to Leela, practically leering. Her response, that he forgot about her so quickly when he met Colleen, shows that she does indeed have some pain and jealousy due to Fry's instability. Without further comment Fry simply agrees with her, then walks to Amy and propositions her instead. Leela must now be really hurt and angry at Fry, and Fry seems to have taken a step backward in the maturity that Leela always wishes for.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* Yivo lives in an alternate universe on the other side of the cosmic anomaly.\n* Fry's blood doubles as pancake syrup.\n* Leela's [[Wrist LoJack-a-mater]] doubles as a Pong game.\n* An organ from Kif's torso is used as a wedding bouquet.\n* An episode of All My Circuits reveals that Calculon has four personalities.\n* Bender becomes Calculon's official stalker.\n* [[Destructor|Destructor's]] leg temporarily serves as a hiding place for Zapp, Leela, and Amy.\n* Yivo reconstitutes/reincarnates Kif from the slime into which Kif's remains were poured.\n\n===Character Arcs===\n* Bender shits bricks for the second time.

It originally aired in North America on May 7, 2000.\n\n==Story==\nDesperate for food after a visit to the Planet of the Moochers, the [[Planet Express crew]] land on a planet to look for [[Futurama Wiktionary#R|Roddenberries]], and instead find the planet covered in a delectable delicacy, which they decide to sell under the name [[Popplers]]. The crew create a [[Poppler's song|catchy jingle]] and sell Popplers on the street for $1 a dozen, with great success. [[Joseph Gillman|Fishy Joe]] makes the crew an offer to sell the treats at his chain of seafood restaurants for $2 a dozen, of which they get half.\n\nProtesters, including &quot;anti-food activist&quot; [[Free Waterfall, Jr.]] rally outside the [[Planet Express building]]. A Poppler [[Leela]] is about to eat opens its eyes and says &quot;Mama&quot; to her; realizing that Popplers are intelligent, she joins the activists in protesting the trade in Popplers. While at first, the crew reasonably think she is delusional, but when Professor Farnsworth suggests they painfully dissect its brain, leading the terrified Poppler to beg for protection. Shocked, they then vow to help Leela's cause, although they do not get much headway (i.e., Fry handcuffs himself to a revolving door to stop people from going into a Fishy Joe's restaurant, leading to him literally getting walked on). A televised debate between &quot;Fishy Joe&quot; Gilman, Free Waterfall, Jr. and Leela is interrupted by the arrival on [[Earth]] of the [[Omicron Persei 8]], who reveal that Popplers are in fact Omicronian young, with the planet Leela, Fry, and Bender found being one of their nursuries. The [[Omicronian]]s demand vengeance for the eating of their young; the initial demand that Earth 'serve' one human for each of the 198 billion Popplers eaten. However, during negotiations with Zapp, there are revealed to be not as much humans so they eventually settle on Leela, as the discoverer of Popplers, to be presented for consumption.\n\nWhile [[Lrrr]] waits to eat Leela on live television, [[Zapp]] formulates a &quot;brilliant&quot; plan to use an orangutan to be substituted for Leela, in the hopes that the [[Omicronians]]' inability to tell humans apart can be exploited. [[Kif]] attempts to makeover the ape as best he can. Oblivious to the danger it places Leela in, Free Waterfall Jr. reveals that the ape is an ape; [[Ndnd]] confirms it by eating it and Lrrr demands the real Leela. Only the intervention of [[Jrrr]], the poppler Leela didn't eat, saves her. Lrrr eats Free Waterfall, Jr. instead, but feels woozy from eating him and the crew retires to a meal which includes dolphin, which they deem as unintelligent because &quot;it blew all its money on lottery tickets&quot;.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nWhile Leela awaits execution in her cage, Fry tells her that she's beautiful and a great friend.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\nA dolled-up orangutan takes Leela's place at the execution.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two|Problem with Popplers, The]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

After failing to catch anything, a bored [[Bender]] fashions a large fish hook made from [[Amy]]'s beach umbrella, with [[Hermes]]'s manwich on it, and attaches it to the ship's [[Unbreakable Diamond Tether]].\n\nSunset comes, and the crew is ready to head back to [[New New York]]. Bender begins to haul in his line, but he has caught a [[Giant Fish|colossal-mouth bass]]. The bass dives, dragging the ship to the bottom of the ocean before the hook slips loose and Hermes lost his speedos. The Planet Express ship survives its trek to the bottom, but its engines will not work underwater.\n\n[[Professor Farnsworth]] conveniently has an anti-pressure suppository which [[Fry]] uses to go foraging for food with Bender and [[Dr. Zoidberg]]. Separated from them, Fry glimpses a mermaid; but when he returns to the ship, no one believes him. That night, the mermaid [[Umbriel]] lures Fry out of the ship, and they leave to explore the wonders of the ocean bottom. Meanwhile, Zoidberg finds a new home, a large conch shell.\n[[File:Atlanta.jpg|thumb|right|The lost city of Atlanta]]\nThe next morning, the crew finishes modifying the ship to return to the surface, but finds Fry missing. They set off following Zoidberg's sense of smell, and find the legendary lost city of [[Atlanta]]. There they find a civilization of merpeople with southern accents. A documentary, narrated by [[Donovan]], explains that Atlanta moved offshore in an effort to boost tourism and become a bigger Delta hub. The city overdeveloped and its excess weight caused it to sink to the bottom. Everyone that stayed with the city evolved into merpeople, with the assistance of leaking caffeine from Atlanta's Coca-Cola plant.\n\nReady to leave, the crew heads back to the ship, including Zoidberg, whose house burned down from Bender's cigar; no one knows why or even ''how'' this can happen at the bottom of the sea; but Fry wants to stay with Umbriel. Fry settles in to enjoy his life with Umbriel, but when he discovers that the [[Atlantans]]' evolution has made them unable to have sexual intercourse with humans, he runs to try to catch his friends. The ship leaves without him, but Bender's hook is still attached to the tether. Fry grabs hold and is dragged behind the ship. The colossal-mouth bass returns, and is hooked when it swallows Fry whole. The bass stays caught, and Fry returns to the surface with the rest of the crew. Bender's bass sets a world record, until Fry falls out of him and the weight is lowered, resulting in Bender losing his money to a blind orphan; at which point Bender begins choking him. Dr. Zoidberg, having lost his under-sea home, reveals he now lives inside the bass.\n\n== Censorship ==\nA line of dialog was edited for an airing on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. Professor Farnsworth's exclamation of &quot;Sweet [[Zombie Jesus]]!&quot; when the giant fish leaps out of the water had the word &quot;Jesus&quot; muted from the audio track, although the animation for the dialog is left intact. In contrast, airings on TBS's &quot;Too Funny To Sleep&quot; marathon cut the entire scene containing the line.\n\nWhen this episode was shown on Sky1 in the UK, Umbriel's line &quot;I want you to make a Mer-woman out of Mer-me&quot; before she has sex with Fry was muted out due to it being shown before the watershed hour (when more explicit sexual lines would have been allowed).\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry has an affair with Umbriel and at one point actually tells her that he loves her.\n\n===Deaths, near-deaths, mutilations===\nNear the end of the episode, Fry is eaten by a colossal-mouth bass. He emerges later from the fish's mouth, slimy but unharmed.\n===Hermes-isms===\n* ''Like a greensnake under a sugarcane truck''\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nZoidberg pushes Hermes' limits again by devouring Hermes' bait. But Hermes seemed ok with Zoidberg just tasting the bait. So it's possible that Hermes really has forgiven Zoidberg for the Spa 5 incident. He doesn't lash out until Zoidberg gets carried away, referring to Zoidberg as &quot;it&quot; and as a &quot;moochin' crawdad&quot;. The relationship takes a sharp turn later in the episode when Hermes proposes that the rest of the crew cook and eat Dr Zoidberg.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two|Deep South]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

It was originally shown in North America on April 30, 2000.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe [[Planet Express crew]] attends a taping of [[Elzar]]'s television show, [[Essence of Elzar]], much to the joy of [[Bender]], who aspires to become a chef. Bender's personal admiration for Elzar does not prevent him from disrupting the show to be more of a part of it, and when his camera's flashbulb momentarily distracts Elzar, the chef accidentally hits [[Leela]] in the eye with his spice weasel.\n\nAt [[Taco Bellevue Hospital]], Leela is advised to wear an eye patch for a week, and since Leela has only one eye, the accident makes her temporarily blind. Elzar invites the entire crew to dinner at his restaurant in order to make up for the accident. He presents them with individually tailored dishes, and after the dinner, he presents them with a tray of chocolates...with a bill underneath. Unable to pay, facing arrest of the whole crew by [[URL]] and [[Smitty]], and not least because it would mean he would get to work with his idol, Bender suggests he work for Elzar to pay back the debt. The crew hasten to praise Bender's qualifications as an employee.\n\nBender begins working at Elzar's restaurant, [[Elzar's Fine Cuisine]], as a busboy. The three members of the [[Robot Mafia]], the [[Donbot]] and his goons [[Clamps]] and [[Joey Mousepad]], come to eat at Elzar's. Bender attempts at grifting from them convinces the Donbot member that Bender would be a good prospect. Bender is offered a chance to join the Robot Mafia. Needless to say, this is right up Bender's alley, and his first few jobs run smoothly. The mafia tell Bender of their plans for a [[Zuban Cigar]] heist, and recommend that he make sure of an alibi. Bender feigns illness with a video recording, to fool Fry. So, Fry, Leela and Nibbler set out for a delivery. All seems well until the target of the heist comes into view ahead of the mafia ship: the Planet Express ship. With Leela unable to pilot the ship, Fry both fires and steers, but the engines run out of fuel when Clamps clamps the fuel line. The mafia blindfold and tie up Fry and Leela. Bender is now able to move around without them seeing him, and changes the setting on his voice modulator to an upper class English accent. The mafia, checking the ship's log, discover that a Robot is part of the crew; Bender's voice changing allows him to feign finding himself and beating himself up. Even Leela's blindfold coming off doesn't blow his cover, since she can only see a blurred silhouette. Bender pledges to stay behind to finish the &quot;doity woik&quot;, further convincing the Donbot of his ruthlessness and loyalty. When they fly away, he ties himself up, and pretends to have only just regained consciousness. At the [[Planet Express building]], Leela removes her eyepatch, and sees the same blurred silhouette, which turns out to be Farnsworth. [[Tinny Tim]] delivers Bender's share of the loot, and Bender gives him a message to the Donbot: &quot;I'm quitting organized crime. From now on I'll stick to the regular kind&quot; and literally eats the money given from the Robot Mafia.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*The text on the ambulance, which brings Leela to the hospital, says &quot;Meat Truck&quot; in [[Alienese]].\n\n== Censorship ==\n*The line &quot;Sweet Zombie Jesus&quot;, first a subject of controversy in [[The Deep South]], was again censored by [[Wikipedia:Adult_Swim|Adult Swim]] when the episode aired there.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nWhen Leela damages the roof of the spaceship hangar, Hermes says to Zoidberg, &quot;That's comin' outta &lt;u&gt;your&lt;/u&gt; pay.&quot;\n\n===Character Arc===\nThis episode revisits Bender's love of cooking.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Robot Mafia Episodes]]"

But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them.|Fry to Leela}}\n\n'''Love and Rocket''' is episode 57 in [[Season Four]] of ''[[Futurama]]''.  It features the guest voices of [[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[Lucy Liu]].  Much of the material refererced in the episode is drawn from Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's 1968 classic film [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/ 2001: A Space Odyssey].  The love affair between Bender and the ship's personality is a comedic exploration of machine personhood, an issue raised in the film.  The deactivation or killing of the ship's personality actually shares the same complex comedic touch as the film: Kubrick and Clarke had HAL 9000 reduced to pathetically singing &quot;A Bicycle Built for Two&quot; as it died.&lt;ref&gt;James Gilbert. &quot;Auteur with a Capital A,&quot; in Robert Kolker, ed. '''Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, New Essays'''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. (2006), p. 37. ISBN978-0195174533.&lt;/ref&gt; \n\n== Plot ==\nReturning from a delivery, [[Bender]] is having an argument with the [[Planet Express ship]] over art. When he proceeds to his room, the ship snaps off his head. Back at the [[Planet Express building]], Bender screws back his head on, complaining about the ship. [[Professor Farnsworth]] comes in with new uniforms, for [[Planet Express]] is planning on contracting [[Romanticorp]], maker of all things romantic. During a tour, Dr. Farnsworth uses a shock stick to keep [[Leela]] in line. [[Fry]] finds candy hearts with messages on them. He becomes determined to find the right words to woo Leela.\n\nThanks to the contract, the Professor is able to make repairs on the ship that the crew has been suing him about; he taped the cracks in the [[dark matter]] reactor, got a cage for the lion and new software for the ship to adjust its voice. Turning it to female, Bender becomes immediately attracted to her. They begin having fun with their circuits until the others find out. Though it is fraternizing with employees, Leela allows it. Soon, Bender grows tired of the ship and begins cheating on her. Unbeknownst to him, while he is taking out two fembots at [[Elzar's Fine Cuisine]], he is spotted by the ship, who become immediately possessive and erratic.\n\nThe crew delivers a shipment of hearts to [[Omicron Persei 8]]. The [[Omicronians]] become confused with the concept of &quot;wuv&quot; and begin to attack. During the attack, Bender decide to break up with the ship, shattering her mind, bringing them to a complete stop, allowing missiles to impact them.\n\nLuckily, they survive, but the ship's feelings can't be repaired. After getting advice from Leela, the ship irrationally flies near a quasar. With its power of ten billion black holes, it would compress her and Bender into a single quantum singularity. Bender tries pleading with her, pretending to say he loved her but she said if he really loved her, he'd merge his programming with hers. To prevent Fry and Leela from interfering, she shuts off the oxygen and gravity. The organics manage to put on oxygen tanks.\n\nHiding in a shower, the three come up with a plan to deactivate the ship before she kills them all. Luckily, she can't read lips. Bender had to distract her by merging programs, with the risk of losing his personality if the ship engulfs it, while the others deactivate her brain. Bender merges with the ship, going deep into her motherboard. Inside it, he wis portrayed as just his head and the ship is smaller and had a face. He noticed a tube, meaning she is a lot older than she said she was. Bender then &quot;runs&quot; away from the ship.\n\nMeanwhile, Leela slowly attempts to shut down the ship's brain while Fry continued to look for the perfect words. Fry notices Leela's oxygen tank is almost empty but she refuses to listen. So he attaches his tank to hers and falls unconscious. Leela is able to take the ship offline and stop it from plunging into the quasar. But she soon realizes Fry's sacrifice and performed mouth-to-mouth on him. When he awakens, Fry coughs out a candy heart which reads 'U LEAVE ME BREATHLESS'. They find Bender, shaken from his chase, but a bit of the ship's personality has gotten into him. Leela lazily dumps the scattered hearts into the quasar. But, as narrated by Zoidberg, &quot;\n''As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar, a wondrous thing happened, why not. They vaporized into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe, destroying many, many planets, including two gangster planets and a cowboy world. But one planet was exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays but not be destroyed by them: Earth. So all over the world couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg. And no one could have been happier unless it would have also been Valentine's Day. What? It was? Hooray.!!''&quot;.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Injury and Death===\n* The Planet Express ship &quot;accidentally&quot; decapitates Bender with an automatic door.\n* Farnsworth &quot;corrects&quot; Leela with a cattle prod.\n* Romanticorp grows live cuddly bears and then slaughters them for use as teddy bears.\n* Farnsworth incapacitates a fleeing cuddly bear with a cattle prod.\n* Bender slaps Fry in the face when he catches Fry washing the underside of the Planet Express ship, which is having an affair with Bender.\n* Planet Express ship is smacked in the face by an asteroid.\n* Planet Express ship is hit by many Omicronian missiles, and looks rather banged-up, but Leela says that there is no permanent damage.\n* Planet Express ship knocks Leela across the room with a firehose.\n* Bender, Fry, and Leela are thrown against the ceiling when the gravity is turned off.\n* Fry appears to have asphyxiated after giving his oxygen supply to Leela, but she revives him.\n* Zoidberg's narrative of the results of candies being poured into a black hole recounts the destruction of numerous inhabited worlds.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFarnsworth insinuates that Leela is a &quot;bitter husk of a human being who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime.&quot; She accepts his insinuation.\n\nSo far in the series, Fry has had the occasional fit of emotion toward Leela. Most of these fits have related to lust and/or loneliness, while very few seem to have related to genuine feelings for her. There are no surprises this time around. His motivation throughout the episode is to find a way to express his &quot;true&quot; feelings for Leela, feelings that have suddenly and coincidentally appeared on Valentine's Day.\n\nFry latches onto the idea that he can find a perfect way to express his feelings by digging through the candy-hearts for the right message. He doesn't seem to notice Leela's advice, &quot;I'm not attracted to a guy's message, Fry. I'm attracted to the guy.&quot; She makes her current feelings for Fry clear by adding under her breath, &quot;Or not.&quot;\n\nAs if Leela's feelings for Fry weren't clear enough, there is reinforcement. Leela is somewhat scandalized at Bender's affair with the ship. But on reflection she concedes, &quot;given the chance, I'd give in to urges far more shocking.&quot; So she would give in to shocking urges, but not give in to Fry's advances. Fry is clearly far down on her list.\n\nFinding Fry unconscious, Leela seems touched, mostly by the fact that Fry was willing to sacrifice his life to save hers, but also in part by the aptness of the message inscribed on the candy that Fry coughs up when she resuscitates him: &quot;U leave me breathless.&quot; The phenomenon created by dumping the candies into the black hole warms Leela up enough to hold hands with Fry briefly, until Zoidberg interrupts them.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* The Planet Express ship takes on a new, girly, flirty personality when Farnsworth adjusts its voice. Bender is instantly attracted to it, never mind that it was a male five seconds earlier.\n* After a brief merging of software with the ship, Bender is left with some vestige of Planet Express ship's personality.\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

It originally aired in North America on December 3, 2000.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn an attempt to entertain themselves, [[Fry]] and [[Bender]] borrow the [[Planet Express Ship]]. Unfortunately, the ship is anchored to the [[Planet Express Building|building]] using an [[unbreakable diamond tether]]. As the ship is piloted on a round-the-world joyride, the building is dragged behind it, smashing into a number of landmarks, including the Gateway Arch in St. Louis and the Great Wall of China. [[Professor Farnsworth]] has [[Hermes Conrad]] fire Fry and Bender, and fires [[Leela]] as well for leaving the keys in the ship.\n\nWhile Leela re-implants her old [[career chip]], she mixes hers with Fry's. Fry gets hired for Leela's old [[cryogenics]] counselor job; Leela is forced to be a delivery boy while Bender has the hand and the career chip from the Prime minister of [[Norway]].\n\nAt [[Applied Cryogenics]], Fry thaws out [[Pauly Shore]], who was supposed to be thawed out in Hollywood, California. When Fry goes to greet the next thawed person, he is shocked to find that it is his old girlfriend, [[Michelle]].\n\nFry introduces Michelle to the world of the year [[3000]], but she has problems adapting. She re-freezes both herself and Fry for another thousand years. They awake in a desolate wasteland. Trying to make a new life in the world of the future, they join a society of feral adolescents. Tired of [[Butch's girlfriend]] and her fancy coyote hide, Michelle nags Fry to take over as chief so they can have power in their new society. [[Butch]] challenges Fry to [[deathrolling]] and wins when Butch falls down and scrapes his knee. The children are picked up for Hebrew lessons by [[Butch's mother]] in a heavily armored SUV with wheels. A confused Fry, tired of Michelle's nagging, leaves her and wanders through the wilderness on his own.\n\nAfter wandering through a cloud of green mist, Fry finds himself standing in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater. The Planet Express ship lands in the street, and the crew explains that Fry is in Los Angeles, in the year 3000. Fry was in Pauly Shore's tube, and when the delivery crew discovered en route to Hollywood that Pauly Shore wasn't in the tube, they tossed it overboard. A limousine passes by, revealing that Michelle has hooked up with Shore.\n\nAs the Planet Express ship flies home, Bender remarks that Fry was the one who ruined the spaceship and started the whole dilemma and reminds the Professor about his anger with him earlier. He hits a red switch, a trapdoor Fry is standing over opens and he falls through the aperture onto the ground, leaving him stranded there. As he hits the ground, the credits roll.\n\n== Foreshadowing ==\n* Fry mentions that in the 30th century, &quot;brains flew through space&quot;. [[Brainspawn]], levitating brains, are introduced into the series in the episode &quot;[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]&quot;.\n* While working at his new job, Fry asks why a guy froze himself. '''Man''': Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured that time was cyclical.&lt;br /&gt;'''Fry''': Nope. Straight line. Later in the series, we discover in &quot;[[The Late Philip J. Fry]]&quot; that time is in fact cyclical as Bender, Fry, and the Professor go so far into the future, time resets itself and everything starts all over again... twice.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nAfter kicking out Fry, Leela, and Bender, Farnsworth suggests that the remaining staff all talk to Zoidberg. Hermes joins in the friendly conversation.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nWhile trying to remind Fry of the concept of career chips, she prompts him with, &quot;It's how we met.&quot; This could be an attempt on Leela's part to see whether Fry is enlightened enough to remember when they first met. Whether it is such an attempt or not, she is clearly disappointed with Fry's lack of response.\n\nIn this episode Fry re-hooks up with Michelle, his ex-girlfriend from 1999.\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\nWhile interviewing with Leela's old boss, Bender presents a disembodied human arm to the career chip scanner.\n\n===Sal's Speech Impediment===\nSal enunciates his one line with perfect diction.\n\n===Time-Travel===\nNo actual time-travel occurs in this episode, although both Fry and Michelle (and the viewer) believe, on awakening from cryogenic sleep, that they have arrived in the year 4000.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Two]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

It was first aired on February 4, 2001.\n\n== Storyline ==\n[[Amy Wong]] has been receiving phone calls consisting only of panting and gasping since last year. The calls are from [[Kif Kroker]], who is consumed by love for Amy, but finds himself unable to speak to her due to his nervousness and shyness. [[Zapp Brannigan]] offers to talk to him about it, but he just laughs at Kif and ignores him. But when he realizes that Amy and [[Leela]] know each other, he decides to go on a double date: Kif with Amy and Zapp with Leela. Leela only agrees to the date as a favor to Amy and the four go to a [[Le Palm D'Orbit|fashionable restaurant]] on board a space liner, but Leela classifies it to be a &quot;half-date&quot;.\n\nKif tries to greet Amy with flowers and candy, but Zapp tells him giving flowers is wrong and that candy is for dorks (but he ends up cramming down the chocolate and gives the flowers to Leela, who immediately burns them in the candle and stuff them in his drink). Kif takes Zapp's advice about seducing women by handing him his notebook of lines that &quot;he should use as much as you can, fast as you can&quot;, but he discovers are idiotic, such as &quot;the most erotic part about a woman is the boobies.&quot; Before Kif could apologize, Amy storms off. Forlorn, Kif gets onstage to participate in karaoke and sing a heartfelt rendition of [[Wikipedia:Bonnie_Tyler|Bonnie Tyler]]'s 1983 hit song &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;. The gesture touches Amy, but Zapp quickly hijacks the stage to end his &quot;amateur hour&quot; and launches into a performance of &quot;[[Wikipedia:Lola_(song)|Lola]]&quot;, substituting &quot;Leela&quot; for the eponymous love interest of the original song, that disgusts the other passengers, so much they flee the ship in terror. Zapp insists he can steer the restaurant-ship home instead of taking a taxi, but proceeds to crash it into planet [[Amazonia]].\n\nThe four are unharmed, but are heard by the [[Amazonians]], a race of tall, muscular, tribal women. They are about to walk away, but Zapp blows the group's cover by trying to seduce them, also with his notebook, resulting all of them being captured\n[[File:Femputer.png|thumb|right|The Femputer]]\nAfter hearing about the crash, [[Fry]] and [[Bender]] take off in the [[Planet Express Ship]] to find Leela and Amy. They make their way to the Amazonian's city and are also captured. The Amazonians decide to take the men to their leader, the [[Femputer]], a man-hating, wall-sized computer to determine their fate. Along the way, Fry, Zapp, and Bender offend the Amazonians for their inability to dunk in basketball, their usage of intellect and character in the comedy club, and asking if the Femputer was actually hot (one Amazonian responds saying it doesn't matter, and Fry says she probably isn't, resulting a kick in the face).\n\nThe male characters discover the last men died out on Amazonia shortly after the Femputer appeared, and that invasive males were killed by &quot;snu-snu&quot;, which is Amazonian for sex. Fry, Zapp, Kif, and Bender are then chained to be with the Femputer sentencing them to death. When they are told they died of crushed pelvises, this results in mixed feelings of horror and delight from both Fry and Zapp, but merely horror from Kif (whom Zapp then falsely accuses of being gay). Bender is released and is spared from being raped, as he is not technically a man but a man-bot and therefore cannot be punished by snu-snu. Fry, Zapp, and Kif are left, and are taken to the snu-snu chambers and stripped to their underpants and then raped by multiple Amazon women. Kif tells Amy that Zapp gave him the lecherous pick-up lines and that he was the one who kept calling Amy and not speaking and declared he loves her before being taken away.[[File:Femputerbot.png|thumb|left|The Femputer's real face]] Amy is touched by Kif's words, and Leela sends Bender to unwillingly reprogram the Femputer. Although Bender initially refuses, a few angry words of Cantonese and a twisted arm from Amy changes his mind. He sneaks into the Femputer's chamber and attempts to reprogram it by beating it with a wrench. To his surprise he finds that the Femputer is actually a computer operated by a [[fembot]], who came from a world ruled by a vicious Manputer who was actually a manbot. She then advances on him, wondering what to do with him.\n\nBy this point, Fry and even Zapp are exhausted and protesting at their snu-snu raping punishment before being dragged back in the chambers by the Amazonian's. Amy and Leela try to rescue the men, but when Leela tries to use violence, she is simply pulled up from her hair then sat on. Amy sneaks into Kif's snu-snu chamber on a pair of stilts, in order to pass as an Amazonian. Kif is on the ceiling trying to avoid being raped by the Amazonian leader and comes over to Amy. She grabs Kif and flees with him in her arms, but the Amazonians chase them back to the Femputer's chamber. Bender is inside, making out with the fembot. Two voices come from the Femputer, which confuses the Amazonians. After a short while, the Fembot and Bender convince the Amazonians to release all their captives (and for Bender, that they would bring gold). Back on Earth, Fry and Zapp receive treatment for their severe pelvic injuries from the multiple rapes they received from the Amazonians. After Fry and Zapp comment about their experience, which they concur with Bender as &quot;the best mission ever&quot;, Kif asks Amy what the two could do next. Amy whispers something to Kif and the episode fades out with Amy smiling while Kif nervously, breathes heavily.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nHermes suggests that everyone should take his fair share in the effort of cleaning up Nibbler's hairballs, but then he assigns the task to Zoidberg alone. This is not necessarily unusual hostility from Hermes; Zoidberg is definitely the omega dog. Hermes later refers to Zoidberg as a &quot;fat fish&quot;. But again, this is not necessarily unusual; Hermes is very protective of the Planet Express budget and might have been reacting to the possibility of Zoidberg buying an expensive new exoskeleton. Finally, near the end of the episode, Hermes explodes at Zoidberg for no particular reason, referring to him as a &quot;windy barnacle&quot;, showing unambiguously that he has some serious issues with Zoidberg.\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\nAt the Planet Express staff meeting, Zoidberg's lifeless exoskeleton is sitting in Zoidberg's place. The other staff members believe it to be Zoidberg himself, concluding that Zoidberg is dead.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry has sex with an indeterminate number of Amazonian women with no sign of any jealousy from Leela or guilt from Fry.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 3]]"

It first aired on December 16, 2001.\n\n==Plot==\nIt's [[Xmas]] time again, and the [[Planet Express crew]] has just finished getting ready for [[Robot Santa Claus]] by covering the whole building in metal shielding. Relieved that all they have to do is stay inside, everyone starts to relax. The [[Professor]] then informs [[Fry]], [[Leela]], and [[Bender]], of some &quot;good news&quot;, they have been hired to deliver letters directly to Santa's base on [[Neptune]]. Reading these sad letters, Leela decides that it's her, Fry, and Bender's job to stop Santa once and for all.\n\nArriving on Neptune the team meets the [[Robot Santa's Elves]] who are actually [[Neptunian]]s, they're &quot;just small because Santa doesn’t feed&quot; them. Leela decides to have them help in the plan. Delivering the letters to Santa, the Neptunians flee and Fry, Leela, and Bender jump out of the sack of letters. Leela attempts to destroy Santa with a logical paradox which should cause him to overload. Leela states to Santa that he is programmed to punish/kill the naughty, but that in turn makes him naughty and thus he must destroy himself. Faced with the paradox Santa's head explodes. Unfortunately, another head pops up and Santa tells them &quot;Nice try but ''my'' head was built with Paradox absorbing crumple zones!&quot;, with that he pulls a bazooka on them and Fry, Leela, and Bender run for their lives. \n[[File:BenderasSanta.jpg|thumb|left|The Elves help Bender take Santa's place]]\nGetting on their ship, the crew tries to take off but find that Santa is holding them down. Luckily, the heat from the rockets causes the ice around Santa to melt and he's frozen in place. The Neptunians [[Back to Work|celebrate]] and start making toys again, however Xmas is now left without a Santa and Bender is dubbed the new Santa. Arriving on Earth &quot;Santa&quot; tries to give out gifts but fails and people mistake him for the evil Robot Santa. He eventually gives up and dumps the toys in a sewer. He gets caught and is taken to court for crimes against humanity. Despite their best efforts Bender is found guilty and sentenced to be executed by being torn apart by giant magnets. Desperate, Fry and Leela decide to return to Neptune to retrieve Santa, who is still trapped in the block of ice to prove that Bender isn't the real Santa. After cutting him out of the ice, though still frozen in a block of it, Leela realizes that the pollution from the toy factory has caused a &quot;Green House Effect&quot; and raised the heat causing the ice to melt. Santa breaks free and chases Fry and Leela back onto the ship. With the previous one having failed, Leela decides that they need a new plan and they fly back to [[Earth]]. Though unknown to them Santa has hitched a ride on the ship, and is now headed to Earth with them.\n\nAt Bender's execution the Planet Express crew all dress up as Santa to save Bender, apart from [[Zoidberg]] who is dressed as Jesus. They fail and Bender starts being torn apart, while singing folk songs due to the magnet's effect on his circuit. Suddenly the real Robot Santa breaks in and saves Bender, Santa asks Bender for his help to &quot;save&quot;(ruin) Xmas. Fry warns him not to do it saying &quot;No, don't do it, he's evil!&quot;, to which the real Santa replies &quot;I know he is but I have no choice&quot;. Santa frees Bender and they both go on an evil rampage.\n\nBack at Planet Express everyone is huddled together in fear. Leela complains that despite everything they did, Xmas ended up just as terrible as ever. They have no heat or power, and are all huddled together in fear. Fry realizes &quot;the true meaning of X-Mas&quot;, all their fear of Santa brings them together, and though it be huddled in the dark, scared, and cold, that's the true meaning of Xmas. Meanwhile, after thoroughly destroying the city and ruining Xmas, Santa gives Bender a present as thanks, though Bender is confused when the box is empty. Santa says, &quot;I might appear empty but the message is clear: play Santa again, and I'll kill you next year!&quot;. Santa viciously kicks Bender out of his sleigh in mid-air.\n\n==The Elves' Song==\n'''Neptunians:'''\nWe are free and fairly sober, with so many toys to build.&lt;br /&gt;\nThe machines are kinda tricky; probably someone will be killed. \n\nBut we gladly work for nothing\n\n'''Fry:''' Which is good because we don't intend to pay\n\n'''Neptunians:''' The elves are back to work today!

However, [[Leela]] refuses to participate, so Farnsworth strips her of command (and her leisure jacket) and gives command to [[Bender]], who treats [[Fry]] like a work boy.\n\nLeela joins the protesters, [[Penguins Unlimited]], lead by [[Free Waterfall Sr.]], who advocates that they form a peace circle around the tanker, unaware that the [[Planet Express ship]] can simply go over them. So the protesters prepare to move to Pluto to stop the delivery. Meanwhile, Fry gets fed up with Bender's obnoxiousness and ends their friendship. This drives Bender to not drink while captaining the ship, resulting in an upside down flight across Pluto. An iceberg gets through all 6000 hulls, dumping dark matter over Pluto and the penguins.\n[[File:Captainbender.jpg|thumb|left|Captain Bender and an irritated Fry]]\nBender is sentenced to help clean up the dark matter. But as the [[URL]] and [[Smitty]] were distracted by hugging, he disguises himself as a penguin to escape. His absence is noticed, so Fry and [[Zoidberg]] take the ship to find him, only to &quot;leave&quot; space and get attacked by a space squid. Bender, in the meantime, gets attacked by an orca whale. When he is found by penguins, his programming reboots to meet their specifications, making him think he's a penguin.\n\nPenguins Unlimited finds that because of the dark matter, both male and female penguins lay six eggs every fifteen minutes. Because of this increasing population that will take out their food supply, Waterfall commences hunting season. Leela objects but Waterfall points out that overpopulation will make the penguins starve so she concedes. But when she finds a flock, she tearfully fires at one but it is actually Bender, who, when seeing Leela, reboots to his normal personality. He teaches the penguins to attack anything not black and white, killing Waterfall senior, at which his [[Old Man Waterfall|father]] swears to avenge him. Unfortunately, when bender takes off his tuxedo, the penguins attack him and Leela, so they run to the sea and move a piece of ice, only for the penguins to swim towards them. Luckily, Fry arrives, using the ship to tip the ice so the penguins fall into the mouth of an orca. As everyone returns to Earth, Leela hopes that nature will eventually correct itself. Unseen, two penguins pick up the discarded guns.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\nAn orca attempts to eat Bender but ends up throwing him back onshore.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Birdbot of Ice-Catraz, The}}\n[[Category:Season Three|Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

It was broadcast as the twelfth episode in the fourth broadcast season.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe episode starts with Zapp Brannigan holding a court trial in the Planet Express Ship, which has new engines on its sides. Kirk is heard preparing his stardate log, only to reveal he and the rest of the cast of Star Trek are in the ship as head in jars. Zapp arrested Fry, Leela, Bender and the actors from Star Trek for going to the forbidden planet, Omega 3. Fry appears on trial first, looking paralyzed in a wheelchair. Zapp tells the possible charges (twelve concurrent death sentences), and Fry responds using beeps, saying he does understand. However, when he is asked if he pleads guilty, he does two beeps (meaning no), but Zapp assumes he said a &quot;double yes&quot; (one beep meant yes). Zapp is about to get his gun, but he gives Fry a chance to explain the situation. He does, in beeps in morse code, telling the story.\n\nA few days ago, the Professor said he's taking a brief nap so the crew went to the video renting store to only get six movies. Fry suggest to get the first six Star Trek movies, but when Fry say the words &quot;Star Trek&quot;, an alarm is triggered, and everybody in the store (except Fry) got down on the ground. Leela whispers to Fry saying that the words &quot;Star Trek&quot; are forbidden. When they heard a patrol car coming, the crew stuff Fry into Bender and walked out of the door.\n\nZapp stopped Fry's story so he can learn more of these forbidden words. He let George Takei to explan why. He explains in a video the show was banned after the Star Trek became an entire religion in the 23rd century, and it was banned because the world leaders were threatened by its influence, and they killed all the Star Trek fans by dumping them into a volcano, and the last copies of the 79 episodes and 6 movies were rocketed to Omega 3. \nZapp then described the situation to be a &quot;brutal and shocking injustice he cared so little about.&quot; Next, he calls Bender to the stand. Fry, as it turns out, was faking looking like he was paralyzed and easily let Bender up to the stand while he beeps the next part of the story.\n\nFry runs to Head Museum to meet Leonard Nimoy's head after what he heard about Star Trek. Nimoy denies even knowing what he is talking about as a security camera was nearby. Fry tries to get him to undeny it, and he finally slips up, but starts to cry and tell Fry about what happened to cast members. He said they left Earth because the Earth doesn't need them anymore. Nimoy wanted to stay because he signed a six month lease for his apartment, so all the celebirty heads were sent on a rocket and left. Fry got mad and then took Nimoy' head so they can get the tapes back so he could show the world how much good they meant for him. Leela and Bender decide to aid Fry, and they go to Omega 3.\n\nWhan got near the planet, Leela loses control of the ship and they crash land on the planet. When they got out of the ship they discover props from the show. Overcome with nostalgia and sadness, Nimoy wishes the cast members were there. Suddenly, the cast from Star Trek come out with bodies, plus a new actor name Welshy (actor who replaced James Doohan) out of the &quot;Guardian of Forever&quot; prop. They said they were on their way to Welshy's cousin's house until their ship was pulled down into the planet and crash landed, and when they woke up, they had bodies. They explained that they loved the planet, as everything was provided for them, and they never age. When Leela asked who's doing this for them, they explain they never really thought about it (they're used to this treatment them being famous celebrities). Then a big, green energy being name Melllvar came out and said he was the one doing everything for them. Bender thought he was a cheesy effect and doubted his powers. He then showed his powers by zapping lightning and killing Welshy.\n\nNext, Leela is brought up to the stand to tell the rest of the story, and she begins telling the conclusion of the story.\n\nMelllvar then showed his powers again by giving Nimoy a body. He explained that centuries ago the rocket that was filled with the tapes crashed on his planet and he watched them over and over and said he has an encyclopedic knowledge of Star Trek. Fry stepps up and said he knows more then Melllvar. This makes him mad and he blasts Welshy's dead body again. Melllvar stated that he's been waiting for Nimoy so he can start his Star Trek Convention. But when Nimoy asks how long it will last, Melllvar shocks everyone saying &quot;until time stops.&quot; One part of the convention they had a trivia contest between Fry and Melllvar. Once Fry got more points than Melllvar, and he got mad stopped the trivia contest. Next, the cast has to perform his fan script. Melllvar doesn't want to ruin the ending so had made Fry, Leela and Bender to go wait in the ship. This was perfect chance for the crew to escape, and they easily did, but reluctantly. They refused to just leave them there, so they made a plan involving blasting engine power to Melllvar, causing his form to explode. While the cast rehearses, the plan backfires as Melllvar absorbed the energy and dragged the ship back to the planet and broke their engine. Melllvar then became confused on who he should worship, the actors of Star Trek, or the Planet Express crew from their brave efforts to save them. He then made the crew and the cast fight to the death. In one part of the fight Leela and Shatner were fighting on a cliff, but then they made out on the cliff. The fight was getting pretty brutal until, in a parody of the plot of the Star Trek episode The Squire of Gothos, Melllvar's mother came out and said it time for dinner. Fry couldn't believe he was just a child, but his mom corrects him saying he's 34. This was a perfect time for the crew and cast to escape. Their ships were both flawed, with the Planet Express ship's engines out, and the cast's ship's life support out, so they fuse the engines onto the Planet Express ship.\n\nWhen they tried to escape, the new engines weren't strong enough, and the ship was too heavy to launch, and the actor's ditched their bodies and put their heads in jars but kept the tapes (instead of the much more obvious and intelligent idea of losing the tapes instead of their bodies). While in space, Melllvar got into his spaceship and started shooting at their ship. All had lost hope, until they come by the Nimbus. Leela thought they were saved, until Zapp arrested them for entering the forbidden zone.\n\nAnd that was the end of the story. Zapp then asked what happens next and Leela said &quot;you started this stupid court marshal&quot; and that they were still being attacked by Melllvar. Right when Melllvar was about to finish them, they are about to take him down using the auto-self-destruct sequence, but Fry questions him why he wants to kill them despite how much he likes them. Melllvar says it's because he doesn't know what to do without them. Fry then gives him advice telling him an entire TV show can't be his entire life. Melllvar thinks about it, and he takes his advice, starting by moving out of his parents' basement and maybe getting a temp job. He thanks Fry, and he returns back to his planet (but he manages to finally outsmart Fry in Star Trek trivia for the first time before he flees, laughing in a geek-like tone). The cast then wonders if Melllvar was truly evil, considering he gave them eternal life and pleasure, concluding he was a blessing. But they catch on when Fry tells all they had to put up with was one really annoying fan, and Shatner says &quot;let's get the hell out of here,&quot; and they return home.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Injury and Death===\n* Fry is roughly crammed into Bender's torso.\n* Nichols' head recounts a historical event in which uncounted nerds are thrown to their deaths in volcanoes.\n* Melllvar electrocutes Welshy, and later electrocutes Welshy's dead body a couple of times.\n* Shatner throws his shoe, which hits Takei in the face.\n* Fry is brought to his knees by a handful of innocuous caterpillars.\n* Takei karate-chops Bender on the shoulder. Basically, everyone beats the crap out of everyone else for a minute.\n* In order to eliminate excess mass for takeoff, the bodies of all the Star Trek crew are thrown out.\n* Bender's head explodes when Takei's head gives an example of a self-destruct code.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nLeela has sex with (or at least makes out with) Shatner.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

It was written by [[Eric Horsted]] and directed by [[Swinton O. Scott III]]\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Bender]] is discovered to be sleepwalking and sleep bending, bending everything in sight, like a vital part of the planet express ship, Hermes' ruler, Amy's college javelin, Zoidberg's prized pet Slinky, in which he reacts to by crying and sobbing, and even the [[Professor]]. Until Bender can satisfy his lust for bending and overcome his sleepwalking, he is forbidden from returning to [[Planet Express]]. Bender finds work at a factory where all the workers are on strike. After securing a job Bender is introduced to his co-workers: an attractive fembot,  [[Angleyne|Angelyne]] and [[Flexo]]. Bender falls in love with Angelyne and the two get along fine until he makes a shocking discovery: Flexo and Angelyne are divorced. Naturally Bender perceives Flexo as a threat to his romance and attempts to find out who Angelyne loves by taking her to [[The Hip Joint]] posing as Flexo. After a passionate kiss leads to Bender's disguise being foiled, he takes off to the factory to kill Flexo. Unfortunately, the [[Robot Mafia]] also want to kill Flexo which they attempt by dropping an unbendable girder on him. Angelyne arrives on the scene too late, but she rushes to crippled Flexo's side professing her love for him. Bender, wanting to make Angelyne happy, decides to bend the girder to save Flexo. After succeeding Bender returns to Planet Express, his bend lust satisfied, but gets irate after being bugged to de-bend the Professor, so he simply bends him 180 degrees much to the dismay of his co-workers.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Hermes-isms===\n* ''Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe'' \n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nDuring the crash review meeting, Hermes turns and makes a friendly comment to Zoidberg, indicating that he can at times contain his hostility toward Zoidberg and even appear polite. Later, Hermes and Zoidberg sit together cordially while each attempts to repair his belongings that Bender damaged while sleep-bending. They also sit together at Bender's celebration dinner.\n\n===Sal's Speech Impediment===\nSal's first line in this episode is, &quot;Nevers!&quot; His disease is weighing heavily on him at the moment. Later in the episode Sal begins to push the limits of unintelligibility, but he does temporarily regain himself and utter one full sentence with no unnecessary pluralization, showing that he hasn't yet completely succumbed to the disorder.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\nThe bending unit Flexo, who looks exactly like Bender except for his goatee, is featured. Bender impersonates Flexo on a date with Angelyne. Naturally, Bender and Flexo fight: they use identical moves on each other, which results in them punching each other's fists.\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\nBender's arms fall off when he tries to bend a week-old loaf of bread at Elzar's Restaurant. An unbendable girder smashes Flexo so badly that he even says, &quot;I'm dying.&quot; Both characters recover: Flexo immediately goes on to have sex with Angelyne on the factory floor.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nIt is as though the feelings Fry expressed just a couple of episodes back, in [[Parasites Lost]], never existed. There is no sign that he has any feelings for Leela at all.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Three]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Hearing the news, [[Nibbler]] runs off downtown, chased by [[Leela]]. Leela looks for Nibbler, tempting him with a ham. Going down an alley, Leela is suddenly chased by gigantic flying [[Brain Spawn|brains]]. She finds Nibbler on the other side of a fence pulling a [[Kitten Class Attack Ship|little space ship]] out of a makeshift hanger. She begs Nibbler to help her, but Nibbler only answers with a sad face and flies off, only to change his mind.\n\nTo Leela's surprise Nibbler comes back and rescues her, Leela being crammed into his ship. Nibbler telepathically talks to her explaining that he is a super intelligent being from a race of aliens that he been watching over the universe and that he is taking her to his home planet. Meanwhile back on [[Earth]], [[Fry]] shows up for work and mysteriously finds everyone has become dumb, including [[Bender]] freaking out when he finds that his &quot;skin&quot; is all cold and clanky, and asks, &quot;Am I a [[robot]]?&quot; when Fry explains that all the things he finds weird is because he's a robot. \n[[File:Nibblerexplains.jpg|thumb|left|''&quot;The fate of your world - perhaps all worlds - rests in his special mind.&quot;'']]\n\nOn Nibbler's [[Eternium|home world]] Leela meets the rest of [[Nibblonians]], who explain that they have been fighting the &quot;Brains&quot; since the beginning of the universe. They also explain that all the recently destroyed planets, including [[Tweenis 12]], were each attacked by the Brains. They explain to Leela that the Brains have a need to know everything and that they hate all other life because the thoughts of other beings hurt them. So to keep other beings from thinking the brains telepathically target the [[delta brainwave]] which allows thought in all beings. This causes the attacked being to become stupid. The Niblonians also tell Leela that there is only one person who can stop the brains, and that person is Fry as he lacks the Delta Brain Wave which all beings including [[human]]s, robots, and plants have, but Fry for some reason doesn’t, instead gathering an assortment of other brain waves into a working one.\n\nBack on Earth, Fry tries to get everyone to stop acting so stupid, first yelling it through the wrong end of a megaphone, then he tries to re-educate his co-workers through his own school class. Back on Nibbler's planet they think of a plan to stop the brains, their fleet in orbit of Earth the Nibblonians plan to send Leela down to earth to deliver their message to Fry to find and defeat the Brain's leader. Leela unfortunately can't be trusted to remember the message as when back on Earth she will be as stupid as everyone else. So they simply write the message on a note and tape it to her chest.\n\nLeela is sent down in a small ship and crash lands in the Planet express building, struggling due her stupidity. She tries to give Fry the letter but her believes it simply to be a tissue and throws it away. Leela tries to explain that the Brains are what’s making everyone dumb; Fry doesn’t believe her until he sees two floating in the window. Taking Leela seriously Fry decides to track down the Brains' leader; realizing that a brain is like a giant nerd, Fry realizes that the Brain leader is hiding at the [[New New York Library]]. \n\n[[File:Big brain.png|thumb|right|The Big Brain at a cocktail party]]\nOnce there, Fry and Leela confront the [[Big Brain]], who has assimilated all of the library's information thanks to the Dewey decimal system. Fry tries to attack it with a book but fails. Fry tries to think of a way to hurt it and realizes that thinking hurts it. Unable to take it the Brain mentally takes their minds and its own into the books on the table including Moby Dick, Tom Sawyer and, Pride and Prejudice. Fry manages to free himself by getting out of range from the brain in real life, only to be crushed under a book case in a failed attempt to kill the Brain. This reality is then revealed to be a false one; Leela and the brain are still trapped in the book world. Having been through all the other books, they are now in one that Fry is writing. To top it off Fry writes that the big Brain leaves for no reason (which Fry spelled as raisin), defeated, the Brains fall to the ground while the Niblonian soldiers eat them. With the Brains' &quot;Delta Brain wave attack&quot; gone and Niblonians having disappeared, everything is back to normal; no one except Fry remembers what happened.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*The columns on Planet Eternium read &quot;Yummy&quot; and &quot;Tummy&quot; in [[Alienese]].\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n===Nibbler===\nFor the first time, Nibbler reveals that he is not just a house pet, but the Niblonian ambassador to Earth. By the end of the episode, everyone except Fry has forgotten the entire incident, and Leela was the only earthling to learn Nibbler's true identity, so in the end, Nibbler is able to resume his original role.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\nAttempting to imprison them, the Big Brain takes Fry and Leela through several alternate universes, each based on a piece of classical fiction. Fry somehow escapes from Pride and Prejudice back to the real universe and writes his own piece of fiction that somehow absorbs Leela and Big Brain.\n\n===Death, Injury===\n* Fry is crushed and killed by a falling bookcase. It is revealed seconds later that the dead Fry was part of an alternate reality created by the real Fry.\n* All of the brains except for Big Brain are eaten gruesomely by the Niblonians.\n===Fry and Leela===\nLeela makes a pass at the Queequeg character from Moby Dick.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Three]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

The act in question appears to be a parody of a Yakov Smirnov &quot;in Soviet Russia...&quot; bit.  The next day, he tells the [[Planet Express crew]] that he's looking up his uncle, [[Harold Zoid]], a star in silent holograms. He writes a letter to Zoid out of his own ink and Zoid invites him and the crew out to [[Hollywood]]. Meanwhile, [[Bender]] poses as [[Calculon]]'s new hot water heater, Boiler.\n\nHaving lunch with his uncle, Zoidberg is told to drop comedy and instead help direct a film Zoid wrote. However, the investment includes a million dollars, which Zoidberg can't even afford.\n\nWith Bender's help, they managed to secure a million dollars from Calculon, due to the fact that he is a fan of Harold Zoid and that Bender guaranteed that he'd win an [[Oscar]]. They create a film, [[The Magnificent Three]], involving Calculon as the Vice President, son of President Zoid. Calculon doesn't want to follow in his father's footsteps. Bender was the executive producer and Zoidberg was a military official. During the premiere, the film is terrible, and as everyone had already left, Calculon swears they are dead. Meanwhile, Leela refuses to pay the valet for parking, accidentally landing her and Fry in the [[La Brea Tar Pits]].\n[[File:That's_Lobstertainment.jpg|thumb|left|The Magnificent  Three]]\n\nCalculon is even more furious that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. He swears to murder them all unless they get him one, so Zoidberg and Bender decide to rig the awards. When they end up at Zoid's home, he unfortunately reveals that he's an even bigger liar than his nephew. He only wanted people to remember him one last time before he dies; Zoidberg refuses to let his uncle go down in shame.\n\nAfter a few weeks, Fry and Leela are unable to free the ship. However, they then find the Los Angeles subway, which they use to escape.\n\nAs the Oscar awards are given out, Zoidberg takes the place of [[Billy Crystal's head]] to announce the Best Actor award. But instead of announcing Calculon, he calls on Zoid. As they celebrate, Calculon comes in to kill them. Zoid concedes his Oscar to Calculon; chastened by his hero's acceptance speech, he spares their lives and vows to earn his own Oscar one day. Suddenly, there is an earthquake, as the [[Planet Express ship]] emerges from underground. Fry and Leela then enter the awards ceremony.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nDuring a staff meeting, Hermes yells at Zoidberg, &quot;You're a crazy, penniless lobster-doctor.&quot; But he says this as a lead-up to some arguably constructive criticism, &quot;No part of you should be a comedian.&quot; After the crew all watch Uncle Zoid's holographic video, Hermes is still almost polite: &quot;You're right, Crabby, he's a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever be.&quot;\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilations===\n* A customer at Zoid's barber shop is decapitated in the middle of a shave.\n* Bender pulls off his own right arm in excitement while on a group tour of Hollywood.\n* Zoidberg flings the head of Billy Crystal out of its jar, causing a crashing sound off-screen.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* Calculon mistakes Bender for a water heater. Bender then passes himself off as Calculon's water heater, calling himself Boiler.\n* Next door to Universal Studios is the grounds of Parallel Universal Studios.\n* A gorilla created using Jack Nicholson's DNA attends the Oscars ceremony.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nThe two are trapped for two full weeks under the La Brea tar pits, and absolutely nothing seems to have happened between them.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Three|That's Lobstertainment]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Images-The Route of All Evil|That's Lobstertainment!]]"

[[Zoidberg|John A. Zoidberg]] immediately makes himself at home, and starts acting like a rich man who has no care for what he destroys. [[Kif Kroker]] arrives but the Wongs are not impressed, even though they introduced him to [[Amy Wong]] in the first place, as he can't take a smoke. They want her to hook up with her friend, [[R.J.]] \n\nDuring the celebration, everyone hears a [[Wikipedia:Throat_singing|strange noise]] and a dust storm rolls in, forcing everyone inside. Outside, the [[buggalo]], the Wongs' main source of income, are swept up in a dust tornado. Kif resolves to find the buggalo to impress Amy's parents. [[Fry]], [[Leela]], [[Bender]] and Kif take the last buggalo, [[Betsy]], who the Wongs intend to cook on Amy's wedding, to attract the rustlers. They camp out on Olympus Mons, the tallest mountain on Mars, waiting. While telling ghost stories, Amy jumps out, having followed them. They discover the buggalo are inside the Olympus Mons' crater. Kif lays dynamite beneath them to dislodge them having learned the basic principle from a seminar on ejecting chickens from a sand dune. Unfortunately, another storms comes in, sweeping the crew inside the eye. They meet the native Martians, who claim that those who have true connection to Mother Mars can fly buggalo. Because their plan to ruin the Wongs had failed, they kidnapped Amy.\n\n \n[[File:FaceofMars.png|thumb|left|The face on Mars]]\nReturning to the ranch with the buggalo, the Wongs are impressed and then not impressed when a mini tornado brings a ransom note. They decide to call for [[Zapp Brannigan]]'s help, against the wishes of Kif. Zapp takes Kif and the crew to the [[face on Mars]], a Martian reserve, to negotiate Amy's release. The Martians demand their land back and Zapp botches the negotiations. Angry, the Martians conjure up another storm to take Amy away. Kif flies in on Betsy to rescue Amy. The Martians see he is connected to Mother Mars and offer to smoke the peace pipe together. Though he initially does well at first, a pat on the back causes him to cough, angering the Martians yet again. They strap him down and prepare to crush him with the bead. It turns out the bead was a giant diamond, which Bender confirmed. The Martians decide to let Kif go, alleviate hostilities, go to another planet and act like it is sacred, having already realized that Mars is a dump. \n\nBack at the ranch, the Wongs believe that Zapp saved the day. They kick Zoidberg out for being a nuisance. Out on the porch, Amy informs Kif that if her parents liked him, she wouldn't like him. As they kiss, the buggalo herd stomps by, fooling Kif into thinking they made love.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Doppelgängers===\nLeo refers to Bender as a &quot;drunken garbage can&quot;.\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\nMrs. Wong beats Zoidberg with one of Leo's stuffed and mounted trophy heads.

After finding out that Zoidberg's pension fund was empty because he never paid into it, Fry realizes his retirement is also in question. After blowing most of his savings, $100, on lottery tickets, Fry opens an account at the [[Big Apple Bank]]. While at the bank, [[Bender]] meets an old acquaintance [[Roberto]], who then robs the bank.\n\nUnfortunately, Fry and Bender are arrested for the robbery, and, due to the aloof attitude of [[Judge Ron Whitey]] both are sentenced to stints in the [[Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots|Asylum for Criminally Insane Robots]]. Fry is sent there because the Home for Criminally Insane Humans was full after Judge Whitey had declared poverty a mental illness.\n\nOnce there, they both take a body test to Bender's enjoyment, but to Fry's own torture (Being stripped, prodded, drilled, X-ray, and being violently dropped into the evaluation room). The doctors refuse to acknowledge that Fry is human, due to their use of the logic that, if Fry is a patient in a robot asylum, he must be a robot. Fry is roomed with car-dealer [[Malfunctioning Eddie]], who is undergoing treatment for his exploding problem when surprised or shocked. Fry perseveres, surviving on food coughed up by a sick [[7¹¹ Robot]].\n\nBut just when Fry thinks he is going to be released, Eddie gets released instead, and Fry gets a new roommate: the insane bank robber Roberto, who was captured after robbing the same bank again. The day after suffering a complete mental breakdown, Fry is released, having been &quot;cured&quot; of his delusion of humanity, causing him to think he's a robot. Roberto, fed up with life in the Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots, breaks out and takes Bender with him.\n\nRoberto then robs the same bank for a third time to thank Bender for his help in escaping, but it's a sting and the pair flee to Planet Express to escape the police. When the Police surround the building, Roberto takes the [[Planet Express|crew]] hostage. Then Fry concludes that he must be a Battle Droid and attacks Roberto to save his friends. In the scuffle, Fry is cut and because of the blood he realizes he must be a human, not a robot.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nWhen reading the mandatory speech for Zoidberg's anniversary, Hermes is mechanical, as he probably would have been with any other employee. But when Zoidberg laments his empty pension account, Hermes calls him a &quot;dumb stinkbug&quot;.\n\n===Hermes-isms===\n* ''Sacred hog of Prague''\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\nMalfunctioning Eddy blows up on more than one occasion. Roberto kills and dismembers Dr. Perceptron in order to use his body parts as a disguise. Roberto viciously stabs Fry in the oil can, and then throws his knife, causing a flesh wound to Fry's arm.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nLamenting Fry's &quot;deprogramming&quot;, Leela presses Fry's head to her chest. Fry's heart rate increases noticeably. Later, Leela gives Fry a romantic kiss in an attempt to reawaken his humanity. They both smile afterward, but Fry continues his robot persona; his only comment on the kiss is a single beep. After Fry rescues the crew from Roberto and remembers that he is human, Leela thanks him by giving him a kiss on the cheek. Fry says that he will never wash that cheek again.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Three]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Back at [[Planet Express]], [[Cubert Farnsworth]] and [[Dwight Conrad]] were suspended from boarding school for salting [[Brett Blob]] for shoving their lunches into a miniature black hole they made. They amuse themselves by using [[Hermes]]' power stamper, forcing him to stamp &quot;VOID&quot; on everything it stamped as tax exempt, and then use the [[Professor]]'s [[Device That Makes Anyone Sound Like Farnsworth|voice changer]] to send the crew off on a bogus pizza delivery to [[Dogdoo 8]] at the edge of the universe. But the universe ends at [[Dogdoo 7]], which they realize a week later. Leela breaks their video game and their fathers order them to get jobs. Dwight and Cubert decide to form a newspaper delivery service called [[Awesome Express]].

Depressed, they decide to get back at them through plan Dwight Lightning; they offer the crew a better deal of pay and soon find that the Professor declared himself dead three years ago as a tax dodge when he took a nap in the park. In technicality, Cubert inherits the company and renames it Awesome Express; they also fire Hermes and the Professor.\n\n=== Act III: &quot;Can we leave this mess behind us?&quot; ===\nBender soon give &quot;birth&quot; to his beer, named [[BenderBrau]]. At that moment, calls start coming in that people haven't gotten their paper delivered in a long time as Dwight and Cubert dumped all of them in a crater on the moon. Panicking, they go to their fathers, who were staying at Hermes', disappointed as they wanted a few more years of being better than their sons. They see another chance but help their sons deliver all the papers with the [[Planet Express ship]]. The last house was Bret's, as they broke his window during their business. The fathers had them go to apologize but [[Horrible Gelatinous Blob|Brett's father]] refuses their apology and the fathers get into a fight in which the humans are severely injured. Later, in a hospital, Brett's father comes to apologize. They drink BenderBrau together.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Injury, Dismemberment===\n* On learning that one can brew one's own beer, Bender's head disconnects and springs away to crash somewhere off-screen.\n* Dwight and Cubert salt Bret into a gelatinous mass that vows revenge.\n* Cubert and Hermes are stamped &quot;tax exempt&quot; by a runaway stamping machine.

[[Bender]] is coaxed into using a giant can opener to open a can of whale oil, which has replaced gasoline. After complaining that the can opener killed his father, he is sucked up by the magnet, cut in a spiral and is completely immobilized.&amp;nbsp; While Bender is in the hospital, he meets [[Beck's head]], who is being attached to a mannequin he found in a dumpster. Beck gives a speech to Bender and gives him a pair of [[robot]] arms to wear around his neck and to play his cut-up torso as a washboard. Beck invites Bender to play in his concert tour. Fry proposes that the [[Planet Express crew]] follow Bender in the hippie van.\n\nFry and the rest of the crew do their laundry and [[Zoidberg]]'s shell runs in the wash, tye-dyeing all the clothes. When [[Amy]] tries to buy something at one of the concerts, she discovers that all of the money was destroyed in the wash, including the change. While on the road, Zoidberg keeps getting sick and coughing up pebbles that are surprisingly pretty and colorful which the others use as a money-making tool. After a forty minute washboard solo that put Beck to sleep, the concert ends. The concert hall is next to a broken robot smelting facility that makes broken robots into paperweights. Bender declares that he will be an icon and a role model for broken robots and that he will play and raise money for them in [[Bend-Aid]].\n\nA day before Bend-Aid, Bender is at the hotel when Fry and the crew walk in and realize that life is better without television. They turn it on and see the Bend-Aid preview. To everyone's amazement Bender gets up and walks during his speech. The next day during the concert, Bender fakes paralysis, while Fry and the crew proceed to sell Zoidberg's &quot;Love beads&quot;. Before the concert, Bender is presented with a very large check. During the concert, Bender shows off and dances and, angry, all the broken robots try to re-break Bender. Bender takes Fry's Van and drives it around San Fransisco in a Bullitt-style chase. During the chase, Bender drives the Van off a Hoverbridge, and it lands on a spot of land. However, Bender is shot into the air. When Bender surfaces he is immediately hit by Beck's bus and tries to fake being paralyzed again but Beck takes the check back. Bender takes a magnet, sticks it on his head and he walks out into the bay to the van, singing, &quot;Fry cracked corn and I don't care, Leela cracked corn and I don't care, Bender cracked corn and he is great, take that you stupid corn!&quot;\n\n== Alienese ==\n*On the map, the State of Utah now reads &quot;Human Farm&quot; in [[Alienese]].\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Character Arcs===\n* The whole episode revisits Bender's dream of being a folk singer, which he first articulated in [[The Series Has Landed]].\n* Bender shits bricks for the first time.\n* Sal is having a good day at the beginning of this episode, delivering his one brief line more-or-less intelligibly.\n\n===Time-Travel===\nInspecting Fry's new van, Farnsworth asks after the &quot;device that speeds or slows the passage of time&quot;.

She simply tells him to cool his jets, literally since his jet pack was melting [[Bender]]'s face. \n\nWhen the crew returns to Earth, Farnsworth notes they got back &quot;none too soon&quot; since while they were gone the Globetrotters held a news conference stating he was a &quot;jive sucker&quot;, and feeds the mutant boys the chronitons. The results are immediate, and drastic. They all age into adults; [[Grotrian]] grows to nearly double normal human height, [[Armo]] gets three extra arms,  [[Thorias]] gets a cannon in his chest, [[Arachneon]] turns into a human/spider hybrid, and [[Lazar]] the ability to shoot energy beams from his eyes. Farnsworth rejoices at his creations; [[Amy]] flirts with the spider superman. \n\nIn [[Madison Cube Garden]], the game begins, with [[Marv Albert's head]] as the commentator, who thinks it &quot;promises to be a by-the-numbers athletic competition with no surprises whatsoever.&quot; \n\nBy halftime, the score is Globetrotters: 42 Supermen: 48, and Albert again notes how dull this showdown is. The game resumes shortly after, but suddenly there's a flash, and everyone is in different places. After another flash occurs, Farnsworth calls a time-out and, realizing time is skipping ahead, assumes his use of chronitons is ripping the seams of time and space. \n\nThe mutant with the chest canon panics hearing this and fires accidentally, pulverizing his human/spider team member. Wanting to impress Leela, Fry offers to take the dead mutant's place, noting that they are 35 points ahead with two minutes left in the game, so there's no way putting him in would cause a problem. Unfortunately, there's another time skip, and they find themselves at the end of the game; the Globetrotters win 244 to 86. Albert finishes with the comment that it's a dark day for humanity; losing in basketball. The Globetrotters gloat and Leela notes that she doesn't know what Fry did during the time skip, but thanks to him all the other planets will be cracking wise about their mamas. Hermes breaks down in tears, thankful his &quot;fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.&quot; \n\nHowever, despite the apparently severe humiliation, Farnsworth immediately reminds everyone that the time skips are far more serious. Tate offers his assistance since he's the senior lecturer in physics at [[Globetrotter U]]. After some techobabble, it is concluded that the universe is doomed unless something is done soon. They are forced to leave the stadium when a time-skip puts them in the path of a charging elephant, part of the circus that takes place the day after the game. \n\nBack in the [[Planet Express building]], time skips are becoming more frequent, and oddly plot/humor relevant. Farnsworth observes that people act normally during the time skips, but end up having no memory of what they did. Bender starts sucking up to Tate hoping to become a Globetrotter. \n\nFry continues to try and romance Leela, stating a romantic bed in a closet is a time-proof shelter &quot;cause when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still&quot;. Time skips and it's apparent she hit him and refused to join him in bed. Leela later complains about Fry's many flaws to [[Zoidberg]], but due to a skip it is not shown. Zoidberg guesses it was boring anyways since after the skip he was watching Television while Leela talked. Leela summarizes that while she likes Fry's kindness, and boyish charm, his immaturity is far too annoying. Zoidberg simply says, &quot;you don't wanna end up old and lonely like ''Zoidberg''&quot;, and breaks down in tears, but immediately recovers his composure. \n\nMeanwhile, using the [[Smell-O-Scope]], Farnsworth has located &quot;time leaks&quot; in the Tempus Nebula. He surmises that when the crew removed the chronitons, it destabilized the nebula, disrupting time throughout the universe. Tate summarizes that when the nebula bounces time particles on matter, bouncing basketballs on Benders head as an analogy, it causes dents, or time skips. He realizes that diverting a bunch of stars could redirect the time particles to the empty side of the universe via their gravity. Unfortunately, such an undertaking would take all of Earth's money, and months to build and install on the Planet Express ship. Thanks to convenient skips however, it all gets done in seconds of perceived time. \n[[File:FryandLeela'swedding.jpg|thumb|right|Fry and Leela's wedding]]\nNear the nebula, we see Leela moving the last sun into position, surrounding the nebula with a circle of suns, and apparently stopping the skips.  Fry congratulates her with a moderately priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne, and showers her with compliments in his quest to get a date, but she still refuses. With advice from Tate he tries again by showing her he learned how to operate the Planet Express ship. This does impress her, but also makes her utterly exasperated, and forces her to state in certain terms that &quot;they'll never ever...&quot; but time skips interrupt her and the two find themselves married. \n\nAn angry Leela accuses Fry of tricking her into marriage, but neither has any idea how this happened. Fry denies being capable of such things, and makes a heartfelt speech about giving the marriage a chance. One skip later finds them divorced.  A heartbroken Fry first tries to figure out what exactly he did to win Leela's heart.\n\nFarnsworth determines that Tate's math was utter nonsense since chronitons can't be moved. Meanwhile, time skips are getting worse with isolated areas moving forward decades. Luckily, the skips allows him and the best minds in the universe, which happen to be the Globetrotters, to come up with another solution quickly. Farnsworth suggests destroying the entire nebula but [[&quot;Curly&quot; Joe]] states that it would take out half the universe. [[&quot;Sweet&quot; Clyde Dixon|&quot;Sweet&quot; Clyde]] suggests that they implode the nebula into a black hole, to prevent more chronitons from escaping. Tate hesitates, noting they'll need a [[Doomsday Device]] to pull off something like that, but the Professor simply responds by pulling six devices out from his collection, musing he could part with one and still be feared. Tate, elated, makes everyone in the room honorary Globetrotters, but, to his chagrin,  Bender isn't there. In a final act of desperation Bender pleads with Tate before they leave, but is forced to admit he's not funky enough to be a Globetrotter. \n\nBack at the nebula, a heartbroken Bender sets the doomsday device, and a heartbroken Fry apologizes for the possibility that he tricked Leela into a marriage, since he still doesn't know what happened. Leela tries to cheer him up, stating they'll always be friends, but it doesn't work, so she tries again by letting Fry move the ship to a safe distance while she preps the doomsday detonator. \n\nAt the helm, Fry realizes he previously moved the stars to spell &quot;I LOVE YOU, LEELA&quot; as an ultimate declaration of love. ''That'' was the thing that finally won Leela's heart. Unfortunately, the implosion device sucks up all the stars a few seconds later. A frantic Fry asks Leela if she saw &quot;it&quot;, but unfortunately she didn't. A depressed Fry simply says, &quot;it&quot; was nothing, and the credits roll.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Time-Travel===\nEven the diehard Futurama fan may find it a bit strange that the series has progressed all the way to the end of the third season before the first actual time-travel. There was the ''appearance'' of time-travel in [[Anthology of Interest I]], but that was &quot;fictional&quot;, being the product of the &quot;What If&quot; machine. The chronotons move time forward only, never backward; this principle is echoed much later in [[The Late Philip J. Fry]], where Farnsworth bullies Fry into testing his time machine, which also can go forward only.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry is suddenly in love with Leela again. He starts off cool, offering Leela a ''romantic'' ride in one of the swan &quot;boats&quot; that aren't actually swans. While they're in space collecting chronotons, he comes on again, suggesting that she and his face get to know each other better. When she rejects him, he says, &quot;Come on, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there.&quot; This is sudden, of course. Other than the one-episode fling of [[Parasites Lost]], Fry has expressed little more than lust and occasional, loneliness-induced desire.\n\nWhen the Earth basketball team loses Arachneon to a cannon incident, Fry volunteers to replace him, expressing a desire to show Leela his skills. Later, Fry lures Leela to a love nest, claiming that it's a time-proof chamber that will protect her from the time skips. A time-jump occurs just after he says something crude--now Leela is gone and Fry has a black eye.\n\nLeela talks to Zoidberg about Fry, indicating that she likes him but is turned off by his immaturity. Again, other than the short-lived fling of Parasites Lost, this is the first positive sign of any kind from Leela. Still, when Fry barrages her with flattery and asks her out, she says that they are just too different, he being a man and she being a woman. She walks away from him without hesitation when Bender asks her to teach him to make cupcakes.\n\nFry makes another attempt to impress Leela by showing her that he has learned how to pilot the ship. She is impressed with him, but she is totally turned off to think that he learned the skill strictly to impress her. Just in the middle of her exclamation that there's no way they could ever be together, time skips forward to their wedding ceremony. But Leela is convinced that she has been duped, and after time skips forward a couple more times, they are divorced.\n\nThey have one last conversation about their relationship, in which they agree that Leela will never feel about Fry the way he feels about her, under any circumstances. Fry obsesses about and eventually discovers the means by which he convinced Leela to marry him, but Leela never gets to see it.\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nIn the opening scene, Hermes and Zoidberg play frisbee together.\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\nArachneon is gruesomely liquefied during a timeout by an accidental blast from Thorias' chest.\n\n===Character Arcs===\nBender is obsessed for the duration of this episode with the idea of being a Globetrotter.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\nBubble Gum refers to Bender as &quot;hot plate&quot;, but it is clear that the term is a deliberate pejorative.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Three]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

FRY.|Lucy LiuBot}}\n\n== Plot ==\nWhile watching an episode of [[The Scary Door]], [[Fry]] decides to do all the things he always wanted to do, and the [[Planet Express crew]] obliges. After demolishing a [[planet]] at Sal's Wrecking Co., visiting the edge of the universe and a parallel universe, and riding a dinosaur at Jurassic Kiddie Park, one of his few remaining fantasies is to date a celebrity. Fry and [[Leela]] venture into the internet to visit nappster.com and download a celebrity's personality. Fry downloads the personality of [[Lucy Liu]] into a blank [[robot]], which begins projecting an image of her.\n\nFry and the [[LiuBot]] begin dating, aided by her being programmed to like Fry. The other  employees, concerned about his relationship, show him the standard middle-school film, &quot;I Dated A Robot&quot; about the dangers of dating robots. From the film, Fry learns that dating [[robot]]s resulted in the destruction of Earth seen while Fry is frozen in the first episode. Unfortunately, Fry ignores the movie and keeps making out with his Lucy Liu Bot.\n\n[[Bender]], offended by the concept of competing with humans for the attention of [[Fembot]]s, sets off with Leela and [[Zoidberg]] to shut down [[Nappster]]. They arrive at the [[Nappster headquarters]], demanding that they disband. Suddenly, they hear someone crying for help in the adjourning room, and it is revealed that &quot;Nappster&quot; is actually &quot;Kidnappster&quot;. In the back room, they discover that Nappster has been kidnapping the [[Head in Jar|heads]] of celebrities and making illegal copies of them. Leela grabs [[Lucy Liu's head]] and the four take off. The Nappster CFO, [[Jervis]], loads a backup disk of Lucy Liu, and creates a horde of Lucy Liu robots ordered to kill by changing their settings to &quot;Erotic Assassin&quot;.\n\nThe crew, running from the robot horde, duck into a movie theater, [[Loew's-N-Plex]], where Fry is seeing a movie with his Lucy Liu Bot. Everyone ducks into the projection room. Zoidberg discovers a five ton bag of popcorn, and sends it pouring onto the robots on the theater floor. The robots eat their way out from under the popcorn. Fry's Lucy Liu Bot points the projector at the other robots, and the heat causes the popcorn to pop, bursting the robots. At the request of the real Lucy Liu, Fry blanks his robot. He expressed his wish to know the ''real'' Lucy Liu, but she and Bender had fallen in love, making Fry seethe with rage.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*The signs read, &quot;AOL&quot;, &quot;667&quot; and &quot;[[Space Pope|Crocodylus Pontifex]]&quot; in [[Alienese]].\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===The Scary Door===\nThe Planet Express crew, sans Fry, watch the episode about the gambler who is killed and must endure a mini-mashup of Twilight Zone plot lines.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nLeela proposes that the crew take Fry out for the day to realize his childhood sci-fi fantasies. Fry uses her proposal as an opportunity to aim some sexual innuendo at her. She rejects him summarily. Leela helps Fry in his quest to find a celebrity for him &quot;to be romantically linked with&quot;. A Lucy Liu-bot is built for him, and he has an affair with it.\n\n===Sal's Speech Impediment===\nSal is all but unintelligible at this point.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\nThe crew visit the edge of the universe, where they find a parallel universe with cowboy versions of all of them. Farnsworth explains to Fry that there are only the two universes, not an infinite number. Fry and Leela use Farnsworth's virtual-reality machine to browse the Internet. Hordes of Lucy Liu-bots attack the city as Leela, Bender, and Zoidberg attempt to rescue the head of Lucy Liu from the kidnappers.\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\nA ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' bites off Fry's hands. Fry has them replaced at a store called &quot;Hand Crafters&quot;. All of the Lucy Liu-bots are destroyed, most of them gruesomely. Bender removes from his torso the jarred head of Luciano Pavoratti and callously discards it; the shattering glass can be heard off-screen.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Three]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Fry]] &lt;br&gt; [[Turanga Leela]] (ex-fiancé)\n| status     = Deceased\n| appearance = [[Bender's Big Score]]\n| voiced by  = [[Billy West]]}}\n\n'''Philip J. Fry''' (August 14, 1974 - January 1, 3008), better known as '''Fry''' and his alias '''Lars Fillmore''', is a time-duplicate of [[Fry]] living under an assumed name. He worked as a technician at the [[Head Museum]], where he met [[Leela]] and briefly dated her, prior to his true identity being revealed. His personality was once said to be Fry's before he gained some maturity and intelligence.\n\n==Bender's Big Score==\nFry, while being chased by [[Nudar]], exclaims he hates the future and reading the time travel code on his buttocks with a magnifying glass is sent back to the year [[2000]]. He encounters Bender's time duplicate and pushes him into the Cryogenic tube before leaving and heading to [[Panucci's Pizza]] where he asks for a slice, but lacking money (from that era), he returns to the cryogenic lab to eat [[I.C. Weiner |I.C. Weiner's]] pizza from earlier in the night. The pizza was ice cold, so he goes back in time to get it while it was warm, thus creating the time-duplicate Fry who would eventually become Lars. Fry watched as his duplicate shoved Bender in the cryogenic tube before approaching his duplicate who would ask why he was there as the original why he used the code. After arguing for a while, which unknowingly prevents the duplicate from seeing the pizza being thrown away, the duplicate Fry left as the original Fry stayed and would accidentally return to the future after falling into a cryogenic tube with his past self. Duplicate Fry then headed back to the Panucci's, where instead of using the time code again, decided to rent the upstairs storage above Panucci's. During this time, the time-duplicate Fry reintegrated into 21st century life, spending time with his family, delivering pizzas, using his Seven Leaf Clover in games against his brother and hanging out with his dog [[Seymour Asses]]. However, it is clear he misses Leela who when he left the future was with a man named Lars.\n\nBy 2003, after three years of pining after a not yet existent Leela, the time-duplicate Fry decides to move on from his past (his past anyway, as it was the future) and after seeing commercial gets a job as a whale caretaker with a disoriented narwhal named [[Leelu]] at the Old New York Aquarium after seeing a special interest story on the evening news. He stays with her until [[2010]], when he had to release her into the sea. Fry decides to try and go after her on a small ship owned by [[Leroy| Mr. Panucci's cousin Leroy]]. After two years of searching, he finally manages to catch her and bring her aboard the ship.\n\nBut like [[Leela]], Leelu wanted to be with another male, a narwhal, instead of Fry. A now emotionally broken and visibly aging Fry hesitantly releases the narwhal and returns to Old New York. He enters his apartment above a now closed and run down [[Panucci's Pizza]]. [[Bender]], being controlled by Nudar and forced to go back in time to kill Fry, the robot destroys the building and inadvertently flash fossilizes an aged Seymour in the process. \n\n(On a related side note: In the newly canonized paradox corrected reality, Seymour is seen being loved and cared for by Fry until 2012 when the dog is inadvertently fossilized by Bender's weapon, explaining his proud and upright stance (instead of the broken dog last shown laying down to die at the end of [[Jurassic Bark]].) These chain of events, by causality cancel out the newly replaced &quot;old / original&quot; reality when the once playful, loving and grateful dog was shown inconsolably waiting for Fry every day outside of Panucci's for 12 years after Fry was frozen.\n\nIn continuation, the inside of the apartment is shown engulfed in flames, burning off Fry's hair as well as damaging his larynx: causing his voice to deepen. Duplicate Fry then discovers he was Lars Filmore all along after seeing both his newly altered appearance in a mirror and an old picture of Lars and Leela compelling him to run to Applied Cryogenics to be frozen by hitching a ride in his former girlfriend Michelle's tube freezing himself to be with Leela, further correcting the paradox.\n\nWhen he awakens in the 31st century, he gets a job at the [[Head Museum]] and eventually meets Leela, during which [[Hermes]] was decapitated and his body was crushed. After a short courtship they decide to get married, but during the wedding, [[Hermes]], who had a time paradox duplicate body made to win back [[LaBarbara]], was decapitated again by causality. After [[Hubert Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] said that time paradox duplicates of living things are predestined to be doomed, Lars realized what he'd be putting Leela through if he died and called off the wedding.\n\nAfter the big battle for [[Earth]], Fry tries to get Lars and Leela back together, but the former says that it is impossible. Just before Lars could tell Fry the whole truth, Nudar shows up, having survived Farnsworth's doomday device through use of a doom-proof vest, demands the time code from Lars, threatening to murder Leela. Lars tricks Nudar by pulling out a self destructing Bender paradox out of the freezer, holds him down over Nudar and all three are killed. The explosion then revealed the time tattoo on Lars' buttocks.\n\nAt his funeral, his living will video is played and it is officially revealed to all that Lars Filmore was indeed a time paradox duplicate of Fry all along.\n\nHe died on December 31, 3007 or January 1, 3008, depending how you look at it.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn July 3011, Fry works as a feeder at the Head Museum and [[Dr. Cahill]] mistakes him for Lars (''[[All the Presidents' Heads]]''). This is ironic as she once worked with Lars for many years and that Fry and Lars were technically the same person.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He must be approximately eighteen years older than Fry (Biological) as he manages to live twelve years in the past between New Years Day 2000 and 2012, and managing to live five or six more years (3002-3007) until his death on New Years in 3007.\n*Before he was revealed as Fry's time duplicate, there were subtle hints Lars was Fry. Firstly, Duplicate Fry had grown slightly older in the past. Secondly, Duplicate Fry had grown a beard (which would get thinner as Lars). Thirdly, he mentioned to Leela that she was the woman who he was waiting for his life which he really did. Lastly, at Leela and Lars' wedding when Professor Farnsworth stated Time Duplicates were always doomed Lars quickly asked &quot;What ?!&quot; and he was so intent on calling off the wedding.\n   \n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Bender's Big Score]]''\n*''[[All the Presidents' Heads]]'' {{C|mentioned only}}\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Aliases]]\n[[Category:Fry family]]"

I used to work in a pizzeria, and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza - Earth style!|Fry}}\n\n== Plot ==\nA new pizza restaurant run by [[Cygnoids]] has moved in across the street from the [[Planet Express building]]. [[Leela]] convinces the others that they should go to greet their new neighbors. They find that the Cygnoids have much to learn about Earth customs. [[Fry]] tries to help them get adjusted, first by giving them advice on how to make pizza, such as not using live bees as an ingredient, and then by suggesting that they learn how to play [[blernsball]]. The [[Planet Express crew]] and the Cygnoids form teams and go to a blernsball diamond in a nearby park. While playing blernsball with the Cygnoids, Leela's lack of depth perception causes her to injure opposing players by beaning them in the head. This gains the notice of the owner of the [[New New York Mets]], [[Abner Doubledeal]]. He thinks having a one-eyed woman repeatedly bean opposing players would be a good novelty act and she becomes the first female player to play professional blernsball. Leela sees herself as a pioneer for women in sports; however, other female players see her as an embarrassment and a joke because she is only able to hit batters and unable to get any outs. Leela is on the fast track to becoming the worst blernsball player ever and seeks help from [[Hank Aaron XXIV]], a distant relative of [[Hank Aaron's head|Hank Aaron]], who is currently the worst blernsball player of all time.\n\nLeela, not wanting to be the worst blernsball player of all time, is delighted when she throws a strike to Hank Aaron after taking his advice. At the next blernsball game, the Cygnoids are selling their pizza in the stadium and their franchise is bought by Fishy Joe. Near the end of the game, Leela pleads to have the chance to prove she is not the worst blernsball player ever, explaining that she has been training with Hank Aaron. The skipper gives in and Leela is found facing the second woman to play in major league blernsball, [[Jackie Anderson]]. Anderson was also the woman who first told Leela that she was making female athletes look bad. Leela throws two strikes, but on the third pitch Anderson hits a grand slam blern and wins the match.\n\nLeela walks away, unhappy until Jackie tells her that Leela really was a role model after all, since she encouraged women to be try harder than ever in order to prove that they weren't all like Leela. Meanwhile, at the blernsball museum, Hank Aaron XXIV sadly leaves his post as the worst blernsball player ever, now occupied by Leela, with the head of the original Hank Aaron consoling him by reminding him that he is still be the worst football player ever.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\n* Countless blernsball players and the head of Bob Uecker are injured by Leela's pitches.\n* Leela accidentally punches Farnsworth in the face.\n* Jackie Anderson is hit by Leela's towel and gets a mouthful of sweat\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nSeeing Leela in her blernsball uniform, Fry asks permission to pat her on the butt. She gives him permission. The transaction seems not to hold any particular meaning to Leela, but Fry freaks out over it and can't go through with it.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Leela of Her Own, A}}\n[[Category:Season Three]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

One of these schemes includes spraying graffiti on the side of a building, saying &quot;Bender Lives Large And Kicks Butt.&quot; The building is demolished, and his phrase is reduced to &quot;Bender Licks Butt&quot;. Bender returns the [[Planet Express Building]] to find out that the [[Planet Express crew|crew]] has staged a &quot;funeral&quot; for him, but it ends badly. The [[Professor]] assigns the crew a new mission: deliver a giant sandstone block to the [[planet]] [[O'Cyris IV]].\n\nUpon their arrival, they find a desert world whose society is modeled after ancient [[Egypt]] and who they claim introduced interstellar travel to them. The crew is enslaved to work on the building of the funeral pyramid of [[Pharaoh Hermenthotip]]. Their job is to work alongside the other slaves, moving heavy stone blocks manually. Bender, impressed by the [[Osirin]] Pharaohs' method of ensuring their place in history, becomes a workaholic, working so fast the slave drivers can't even keep up with him.\n\nPharaoh Hermenthotip arrives to inspect his newly completed pyramid; and just as he was about to set everyone free, he is killed when the nose falls off a giant statue of himself. The priests entomb Hermenthotip, and he is remembered in [[Pharaoh's Funeral Song|song]], and the next day they consult their [[wall of prophecy]] to select the new pharaoh. While the slaves partied over their few hours of freedom, Bender sneaks out and makes a few surreptitious modifications to the wall, therefore, the wall declares him the new pharaoh.\n[[File:Bender'srobot.jpg|thumb|right|Bender's Statue]]\nNewly crowned Pharaoh Bender demands a statue of himself, one billion cubits tall, so that he will be remembered forever. Construction proceeds, with Bender quickly establishing himself as an excessively dictatorial and ruthless pharaoh, and the massive statue is soon completed. Nonetheless, when it is unveiled, Pharaoh Bender announces that he is displeased with it, and wants it to be torn down and rebuilt. The high priests, disgusted and tired with Bender, wrap him for burial, and toss him into the tomb, along with [[Fry]] and [[Leela]] at Bender's request.\n\nFry and Leela want to blast their way out using the explosive Schnapps from the tomb's distillery; but Bender objects, worried that he won't be remembered if the statue is destroyed. Fry and Leela make a show of not remembering Bender, and he relents. After blasting a crack in the statue's foot, Fry, Leela, and Bender escape and run back to the [[Planet Express ship]]. As the ship departs from O'Cyris IV, the statue explodes in a gigantic fireball. Bender is distraught, but Leela consoles him with the knowledge that his reign of terror will be remembered longer than any statue. Satisfied, Bender tells the crew to set course for [[Earth]]. As the ship approaches an Earth-like planet, Bender begins to laugh evilly. Leela points out that the planet isn't Earth and Bender stops laughing.

It aired March 31, 2002 on FOX.\n\n==Synopsis==\nA frozen Wall Street investor from the 1980s, known as &quot;That Guy&quot;, takes over control of Planet Express and tries to sell it to Mom.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Planet Express]] holds its stockholders' meeting, and the state of the business is not good. Uninterested in the meeting, [[Fry]] and [[Dr. Zoidberg]] wander off in search of food.  Fry finds his way into a cryogenic defrostee support group meeting, where he meets a sleazy [[#Cultural References|Gordon Gekko]]-esque 1980s businessman referred to only as &quot;[[That Guy]]&quot;, who froze himself to await a cure for his terminal bone-itis.  \n\nFry and That Guy return to the Planet Express stockholders' meeting, where a revolt against [[Professor Farnsworth]] is in progress.  Fry nominates That Guy to be the new CEO; [[That Guy]] gets one vote more than Farnsworth, and takes over Planet Express.  That Guy names Fry his new Vice Chairman, and sets out to remake Planet Express by giving it an expensive image overhaul.\n\nThat Guy's business strategy proves to be the acquisition of flying chairs, expensive suits, and an enigmatic television commercial, which is a reference to the 1984 Macintosh commercial. Fry is impressed, the rest of the crew is appalled, and Zoidberg is hungry; he sells his stock to That Guy for a sandwich. After draining the company's funds and its employees' morale, That Guy announces that he is selling Planet Express to [[Mom]].\n\nThe takeover, ostensibly a shareholder's meeting, begins at the orbiting Intergalactic Stock Exchange, and all the Planet Express employees vote against it. That Guy's vote tips the scales to 51% in favor; his sandwich-bought pile of shares, it is revealed, had been requisitioned to Zoidberg by [[Hermes]] in lieu of toilet paper when the shares were worthless. The shares are now worth a huge sum, and the crew contemplate the loss of their company and the gaining of incredible wealth, save for Zoidberg, who is left to contemplate the worth of his sandwich. Before the final approval of the merger takes place, That Guy's uncured bone-itis enters its final stage, causing his body to contort and bones snap, twist and curl. That Guy bemoans that he had been so busy &quot;being an 80s guy&quot;, he had forgotten to get it treated.\n\nFry gains control of That Guy's shares, and moves to vote against the merger. The Planet Express staff initially tries to convince him to sell the company, because the sale of their stock will make them all rich. However, the very speech that Fry gives to announce his new plans for the company drives the stock's price through the floor. Since the staff will be poor no matter what he does, he votes against the merger. \n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\n* The stockholders' annual report video depicts the Planet Express ship crashing. \n* Two gorillas pummel each other, pro-wrestling style, at the Big Ape Fight. \n* Calculon is hit in the head by a clown-tricycle at the Big Ape Fight. \n* Mom stooge-slaps her sons. \n* Fry falls down a flight of stairs. \n* That Guy suffers a fatal attack of bone-itis on live television. \n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nHermes chastises Zoidberg for not refrigerating his sandwich, calling him a &quot;spineless lobster&quot;.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Three]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Mom Episodes]]"

[[Dr. Zoidberg]] prescribes them a &quot;miracle cream&quot;. While returning the broken supercollider to the store, Fry and Leela are mugged. They discover they are immune to laser fire and physical attacks, a side effect of the &quot;miracle cream&quot;; they also gain the abilities of super strength and super speed. They form a team of superheroes, [[The New Justice Team]] taking the names [[Captain Yesterday]], [[Clobberella]], and [[Bender]] joining them as [[Super King]].\n\nLeela makes a visit to [[CitiHall]], and procures a special one-day surface pass for her mutant parents, [[Morris]] and [[Munda]]. Shortly after, the mayor summons the New Justice Team to deal with a criminal threat. [[The Museum of Natural History]] is going to be robbed of the [[Quantum Gemerald]] at 9 a.m. by a criminal mastermind called [[The Zookeeper]], who uses trained animals to aid him in his crimes.\n\nLeela, planning her day, schedules her parents' surface visit for 10 a.m. at the same museum. Her plans are ruined when the Zookeeper is an hour late for the theft. The New Justice Team foils the robbery, but the Zookeeper escapes. Leela's parents, convinced that Leela didn't show up because she's ashamed of them, slink back to the sewers, just a moment before Leela rushes out onto the street.\n\nLeela makes a trip to her parents' home where she reveals her superhero identity. Leela swears them to secrecy for their own protection, but Morris tells his friends, and the word spreads. Shortly after, [[Planet Express crew]] receives a call from the Zookeeper, who has kidnapped Leela's parents. He is willing to ransom them for The Quantum Gemerald, which he demands they steal for him.\n\nThe New Justice Team resolves to steal the gem. Unfortunately, they have run out of miracle cream, and are forced to commit the robbery without super powers. Fortunately, the museum guards still think The Team have superpowers, and the Gemerald is retrieved successfully. The Quantum Gemerald is given to the Zookeeper, who releases Leela's parents and escapes. Bender and a morally confused Fry set off to commit a few more crimes while they still have their superhero costumes, and life returns to normal.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*The [[Alienese]] warning on the miracle cream tube reads, &quot;Keep out of reach of children under the age of five hundred.

Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer.|Big Brain}}\n\n'''The Why of Fry''' is the eighth episode of [[Season 5 (broadcast)|Season 5]] of ''[[Futurama]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Fry]] is preparing for a mission, only to learn that [[Bender]] and [[Leela]] had just returned. Not only finishing the mission but doing it even better than usual since they earned medals for the mission while he was looking up curse words in the dictionary. While the latter clean themselves up, Fry states that they could've needed him but Bender denies it. Fry has the last laugh after tricking Bender into denying that he is great.\n\nWhile Leela is on her date with [[Chaz]], the [[Mayor Poopenmayer|mayor's]] aide, Fry walks [[Nibbler]] for her. Fry feels that he is useless, only to have Nibbler tell him otherwise. Nibbler knocks Fry out, drags him to his small spaceship, and takes him to [[planet]] [[Eternium]]. After being introduced to the [[Nibblonian]]s, Fry's learns his importance; he has a unique genetic disorder which resulted in him lacking the [[delta brainwave]] due to him [[Roswell that Ends Well|becoming his own grandfather]]. This rendered him immune to the attack of the [[Brainspawn]] a few months ago, an attack which no-one else on [[Earth]] remembers.\n\n[[File:BrainSpawn.png|thumb|right|the Brainspawns]]\nThe Nibblonians reveal the Brainspawn's plan: to collect all knowledge in the universe and destroy it so no new information pops up. Fry, because of his immunity, is the only person who can stop them. In other words, Fry is the most important being in the universe. The Nibblonians have made a [[quantum interface bomb]] which will send the [[Infosphere]] into an alternate dimension forever. Fry's mission is to implant it inside the Infosphere. The Nibblonians bring Fry to the Infosphere just as it collects the last of all the data in the universe. It opens to scan itself, the final piece of information. This is the only chance to get in, so the Nibblonians send Fry in on the [[Scooty-Puff, Jr.]].\n\nFry arrives at the center of the sphere, rendered invisible by his genetic abnormality as long as he avoids intense thinking. He is about to activate the bomb, but realizes that while he is there, he can find the answers to any question in the universe. He asks questions: &quot;What's stamp glue made of?&quot; and &quot;What killed the dinosaurs?&quot;, which answers toad mucus and that the Infosphere himself killed the dinosaurs respectively. Fry is discovered and the Brainspawn try to stop him, but his immunity protects him. He tries to escape, but the Scooty Puff Jr. falls apart, trapping him. The Brainspawn identify Fry as &quot;The Fable One&quot; and gloat that he cannot escape. Their laughing ceases when Fry holds up the bomb and activates it. The Brainspawn remind that him that he is doomed to enter the alternate universe with them. One brain adds that they'll also form a clique that Fry won't be part of. But Fry boasts that he is glad that his life had a purpose: &quot;Leading good to victory over evil&quot;.\n\nThe Brainspawn question his motivations, suggesting that the Nibblonians are not as good as they appear. They suggest that Fry inquire about the night of [[December 31st, 1999]], the date Fry got frozen. Nibbler nervously tells Fry not to ask, saying that it would be boring, so he concedes, only to be urged by the [[Big Brain]]. It is revealed that Nibbler unbalanced the chair that Fry was sitting on that night, tipping him into the [[cryogenic tube]] and bringing him to the future. Nibbler explains that Fry was the only person who could carry out the mission against the Brainspawn's Infosphere. As Fry grapples with the shock that the Nibblonians ruined his life, he and the Infosphere are sent to the alternate universe.\n\n[[File:Chaz.png|thumb|left|Chaz with his badge]]\nMeanwhile, Leela is on a date with Chaz, having a luxurious dinner at [[Elzar's Fine Cuisine]]. Chaz reserves the rocket ice rink specially for Leela, denying its use to the orphans who were supposed to visit the rink. Leela, having grown up as an orphan herself, tries to persuade Chaz to allow the orphans to use the ice rink, but he refuses. Leela realizes that Chaz abuses his position and completely ignores the needy. She shoves his badge in his mouth and leaves.\n\nIn the other dimension, the Brainspawn decide to spend their eternity singing [[Wikipedia:American_Pie|American Pie]]. Fry, on the other hand, wishes that the Nibblonians hadn't froze him. The Infosphere informs him that it is possible for him to go back in time to stop Nibbler from freezing him. The Infosphere explains that there is a nexus point between dimensions at the space-time that he entered the cryogenic tube and only Fry can return there. The Big Brain endorses this, as it would be a win-win situation - Fry can have his old life back and the Brainspawn can understand and destroy the universe a millennia later. Fry accepts their offer. The Brainspawn then begin calculating to send Fry back. Fry asks the Brainspawn if they check their calculations. The Big Brain says &quot;Our calculations are always correct, for we are gigantic brains.&quot; and Fry is transported to the [[Applied Cryogenics|cryogenics lab]].\n\nOn December 31st, 1999, Nibbler places a prank order for [[I.C. Weiner]], but future Fry appears behind Nibbler under the desk, just before his past self is frozen. He restrains Nibbler, who is confused at this paradox. Fry assumes that Nibbler has traveled through time as well, but Nibbler explains that his people lack that ability, but possess longevity, and Fry first met Nibbler when he was a thousand years older. However, Fry refuses to let himself be frozen. Nibbler pleads that the Nibblonian sages have foreseen that in a thousand years, the universe will depend on Fry. Because he would have died of old age almost a thousand years before the mission was to take place, they had to freeze him in 1999. Fry points out that they could've asked him; Nibbler says that they were afraid that he would refuse. Fry denies it, saying he loves the future; the Nibblonian then asks why Fry is choking him right now; Fry asserts that he doesn't &quot;like being used&quot; and puts Nibbler down. Leaving the choice to Fry, Nibbler asks if there is anything he wants to save in the future and Fry realizes the only thing worth saving is Leela. Fry mentions this to Nibbler, who mysteriously notes that Leela may be the &quot;Other&quot;, and advises Fry not to give up on her. He promises if Fry makes the right choice, back in the 31st century Nibbler will help Fry win Leela's heart. As New York counts down to New Year's, Fry gives in and unbalances the chair himself, freezing his past self. Before he fades away, he yells &quot;Just remember that Scooty Puff Jr. sucks!&quot; Nibbler vows that &quot;in a thousand years, I'll get right on it&quot;.\n\nBack in the 31st century, Fry escapes the InfoSphere on a [[Scooty-Puff, Sr.]] and Nibbler returns Fry to Earth, blanking Fry's mind of what happened to remain undercover, but not before handing Fry a flower. At [[Planet Express]], Fry gives Leela the flower. Leela, touched, gives Fry a kiss.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*The columns on [[Eternium]] say &quot;fuzzy wuzzy&quot; in [[Alienese]].\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Doppelgängers===\n* Fry, Amy, and Zoidberg pretend that they constitute a delivery team and rehearse a delivery.\n* Fry uses a quantum interface bomb to blast the brains (and himself) into an alternate universe. Later, after some time-travel, he blasts the brains (only) into an alternate universe.\n* The giant brain uses some sort of telepathic energy to serve as a hand for typing on a computer keyboard.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry, attempting to assuage his own guilt over missing a delivery mission, wants to make it up to Leela by taking her out to dinner. This is typical of Fry, to miss the point entirely and to have the wrong reasons for asking her out. Typical of Leela is her rejection of Fry. In fact, not only does she reject him categorically, she also explains that she is going out with Chaz, the mayor's aide.\n\nWhen Fry and Leela cross paths while she is out on her date with Chaz, Fry has a brief moment of happiness due to his hope that the date is not going well. Leela crushes his hopes when she tells him that the date is going very well, asking him to walk Nibbler.\n\nWhile Fry from the future argues with Nibbler of 1999, Fry mentions that he has feelings for Leela, but also that she doesn't care for him. Nibbler offers to help Fry with respect to Leela, if Fry will agree to push his 1999 self into the cryo-tube. Fry is won over to Nibbler's request when Nibbler frames the issue as &quot;save yourself or save Leela.&quot;\n\nOn returning to the office from her bad date with Chaz, Leela has Bender burn Chaz' face out of a photo of Leela and Chaz together. While Leela looks at the photo with a hole in it, Fry walks into the room and appears, from Leela's perspective, in the hole where Chaz' face had been. Leela is happy to see Fry, and actually gives him a kiss on the lips.\n\n===Death, Injury===\n* Elzar bams a cockroach to death with a loaf of bread.\n* Fry savagely kicks a robotic trash can, a mother of six kids, knocking her over on her side.\n* Nibbler knocks Fry unconscious with a sock-weapon.\n* At the Feast of A Thousand Beasts, an indefinite number of beasts are eaten alive.\n* The brain console depicts a toad being harvested for its mucus.\n* The brain console depicts a giant brain killing dinosaurs.\n* Leela stuffs Chaz' wallet into his mouth.\n\n===Nibbler===\nFor the second time, Nibbler reveals that he can talk, this time to Fry. In [[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]], Nibbler revealed his identity to Leela, but she fell victim to the worldwide memory lapse, so Fry is temporarily the only earthling who knows Nibbler's identity.\n\nThe brain console reveals that it wasn't accidental that Fry fell into the cryogenic chamber back in 1999: Nibbler was there, and he blew on Fry's chair to make sure Fry would fall into the chamber. It is also revealed that Nibbler himself placed the phone call to Panucci's Pizza to be delivered to I.C. Wiener at the cryogenics lab.\n\nAfter returning to Earth, Fry tells Nibbler, &quot;If you ever need a savior again, just ask.&quot; Nibbler provides some foreshadowing with, &quot;We will. We will.&quot; Not long afterward, Nibbler erases Fry's memory, so once again, no one on Earth knows that Nibbler can talk.\n\n===Character Arcs===\nFry discovers that he is the single most important person in the universe due to his lack of a delta brain wave. In The Day the Earth Stood Stupid, he saved Earth, but here he saves the entire universe. His unique importance, and in particular the unique importance of his brain disorder, is revisited in [[Into the Wild Green Yonder]].\n\n===Time-Travel===\nIn addition to explaining Fry's importance, Ken the Nibblonian also explains that Fry's delta-brain-wave disorder is a result of &quot;certain actions&quot; performed by Fry, in [[Roswell That Ends Well]], which resulted in Fry being his own grandfather.\n\nAfter Fry transports himself and the brains to an alternate universe, the brains send him back in time, to the night in 1999 when Fry was frozen. Nibbler is there at the cryogenics lab, hiding under a desk, when future-Fry arrives. Future-Fry grabs Nibbler and has a brief conversation in which he learns that Nibbler's people are long-lived and incapable of time-travel. So Nibbler was at the cryogenics lab normally, without the use of time-travel. This explains the scene in [[Jurassic Bark]] where we see Nibbler hiding in the wastepaper basket at the cryogenics lab.\n\nJust before future-Fry ceases to exist, he asks Nibbler to remember that Scooty-Puff Juniors (the toy on which future-Fry hoped to escape from the Brain Sphere) suck, so the next Fry (the one now in the cryo-tube) will have a means of escape when the time comes.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 4]]"

He is a bit into the theatrical, bursting into song when possible and has a bit of talent for it judging from his brief performance at the opera. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs head of the [[League of Robots]], Bender sold the soul of his [[Bender's firstborn son|firstborn]] to Beelzebot in exchange for an [[Army of the Damned]], something Beelzebot claimed was cold-blooded even by &quot;his&quot; standards.(Arguments pursue whether or not that was his actual son, due his surprise and confusion in &quot;The Bots and the Bee's&quot;  because of him not knowing the facts of life.) His hands are very well coordinated. He can swap his hands with any human very fast and the human doesn't feel any pain. His arms, legs, upper and lower torso resemble bender's body parts very much though his fingers are pointed and his feet are two-toed (much like the cloven hooves of the Christian devil) rather than Bender's semi-sphere feet. He also has a bit of flamboyancy in his speech and movements, easily angered by being mocked. He is a bit hypocritical, once confronting Fry about his opera characters &quot;lacking subtlety&quot; and &quot;announcing how they feel&quot; by saying &quot;That makes me feel angry!&quot; Beelzebot has backup bodies in case he dies and goes to Robot Hell.\n\n=== Band ===\nBeelzebot has a small musical band who play the Robot Hell Theme Song. The group plays at the wedding of [[Lars]] and [[Leela]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bender's Big Score]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and apparently seem to be able to appear whenever Beelzebot spontaneously breaks into song.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n* &quot;[[Hell is Other Robots]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[A Tale of Two Santas]]&quot; (voiced by Maurice LaMarche)\n* &quot;[[Crimes of the Hot]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Ghost in the Machines]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Mutants Are Revolting]]&quot; (no dialogue)\n* &quot;[[The Six Million Dollar Mon]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Silence of the Clamps]]&quot; (no dialogue)\n* &quot;[[Forty Percent Leadbelly]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Inhuman Torch]]&quot; (no dialogue)\n* &quot;[[Calculon 2.0]]&quot;\n\n=== Films ===\n*''[[Bender's Big Score]]'' {{C|No voice role}}\n*''[[Bender's Game]]'' {{C|No voice role}}\n*''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]'' {{C|1 = voiced by Dan Castellaneta}}\n*''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''\n\n=== Comics ===\n*''[[Futurama Returns]]''\n\n== Footnotes ==\n&lt;references /&gt;\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Villains]]"

While touring the campus, Bender comes across a chapter of his old fraternity, [[Epsilon Rho Rho]] (ERR). The nerdy fraternity brothers beg Bender for his help in the art of being cool, as &quot;We're the lamest [[wikipedia:Fraternity|frat]] on campus! Even [[Wikipedia:Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel]] has better parties than us!&quot; Meanwhile, when Fry reveals to Leela and the Professor that he went to college but dropped out, they explain to Fry that being a 20th/21st-century college dropout is the academic equivalent to a mere high school dropout in the 31st-century. Knowing this, Fry vows to enroll and drop out all over again. Later, in a scene straight from [[wikipedia:National Lampoon's Animal House|Animal House]], Bender and the Robot House boys climb a ladder to peek in a girls' dorm room window (in reality, they're only trying to see one of the girls' computers as it malfunctions, which for Bender and the nerds is a major turn-on). A risqué mishap happens when Bender's extendable eyes causes them to fall. The accident crushes Snooty House's servants' quarters, and presumably the servants themselves (one of the members says, &quot;I say, you've damaged our servants quarters...and our servants&quot;).\n\n[[File:Guenter&amp;Fry.png|thumb|left|Fry doesn't like his new roommate]]\nFry gets a room in the financial aid dorm, and finds his roommate, Günter, an intelligent monkey wearing an undersized hat. The Professor enters, and reveals that Günter was the contents of the crate, and that the electronium hat is the source of Günter's intelligence. Bender and the Robot House members get called before Dean Vernon, who places them on dodecatuple secret probation and have to run out after Fatbot eats the Dean's model ship (Fatbot explains that he gets hungry when he's nervous and/or scared). At the parents' reception, Fry humiliates Günter by releasing Günter's unintelligent, feral parents from their cage. Later, Günter expresses his unhappiness at his current life. At the 20th century history exam, the stress finally becomes too much for him, and he tosses the hat aside, jumps out the window, and flees into the Martian jungle. While Fry, Leela, and the Professor head off into the jungle to find Günter, Robot House enters the fraternity raft regatta in a bid to lift their probation status. When Günter's found, the Professor offers him the hat while Fry offers him a banana.\n\n[[File:Mars University.jpg|thumb|The Professor's subject being taught]]\nBefore Günter can decide, Robot House speeds past with Bender on water skis. The boat's wake drags the humans into the river and towards a waterfall. Günter puts the hat on and rescues them, but falls off a cliff. The Planet Express Crew believe him to be dead, and go to &quot;gather him up.&quot; They find however, that the hat broke his fall, and is now only working at half-capacity. Günter announces that he likes the new reduced-capacity hat, and that he's decided to transfer to business school, to the horror of Professor Farnsworth. Robot House wins the regatta, and a parade in their honor is held, led by an unhappy Dean Vernon. The episode ends with a party at Robot House, and an epilogue shown in the style of &quot;Animal House&quot; and &quot;[[Wikipedia:American Graffiti|American Graffiti]]&quot; where captions explain that Fry successfully dropped out of college and returned to Planet Express, Günter went to business school to get his MBA and became The FOX Network's latest CEO, Fat-Bot caught a virus in Tijuana and had to be rebooted, Leela went on a date with Dean Vernon (and Vernon never called her again), and with his task done, Bender stole everything of value from Robot House and ran off.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Articles in need of a re-write]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 1]]"

When Hermes lost his body, LaBarbara left Hermes and remarried Barbados.\n\nHermes and Barbados have always been rivals, as the latter always wins a competition every time the two have met. In the [[3004]] Olympics, they competed against each other in the limbo games. Hermes, who hadn't limboed in twenty years due to a traumatic accident involving limbo, wore a [[Flabo Dynamic Suit]]. The suit pushed Hermes' center of gravity closer to his knees, giving him a skinny physique which Barbados mocked. As the limbo race began, it seemed that Hermes would win. However, when the suit tore, Barbados won as usual.\n\nIn [[3008]], Hermes' head was accidentally chopped off and had to be preserved in a [[Head in Jar|jar]] while his body was being repaired. LaBarbara left him and re-married Barbados, as well as having [[Dwight Conrad|Dwight]]'s surname changed. However, when Hermes used his bureaucratic mind to assist the [[Earth]] fleet in retaking Earth from the [[Nude Alien Scammers]], LaBarbara took him back. Barbados swore that they haven't seen the last of him, but then said &quot;Goodbye Forever&quot;. As he exited the bridge he was pinned down by the sliding door.\n\nIn The Mutants are Revolting, he can be seen dancing with LaBarbara at the Planet Express 100th Delivery Party.\n\nHe was seen in The Bots and the Bees where he was sadly looking jealous of Hermes and LaBarbara expressing love to each other before Hermes left for work at their house.\n\nHe can be a reference about the Jamaican sprinter Asafa Powell.\n\nBarbados Slim is often referred to as a mahogany god.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Bend Her]]''\n*''[[Bender's Big Score]]''\n*''[[The Futurama Holiday Spectacular]]''\n*''[[The Mutants Are Revolting|The Mutants&amp;nbsp;Are Revolting]]''\n*''[[The Bots and the Bees]]''\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]"

She told Fry she left his stuff on the sidewalk as the taxi pulled away.

Michelle could not adjust to her new surroundings and re-froze both herself, and Fry, for another thousand years. Upon awakening, they found themselves in a desolate wasteland. Trying to make a life for themselves, they joined a society of feral adolescents. After the teens were picked up in an armored SUV, Fry grew tired of Michelle's constant nagging and left.

This device provides an internal explanation for the game mechanic of multiple lives in the Futurama video game for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Like the game itself, the Reanimator is not generally considered canon.\n\nThe device is shaped like an old-style toaster, except that it stands about 8 or 9 feet tall.

A body produced by the device emerges from the toaster &quot;slot&quot;, complete with a &quot;toast pop-up&quot; sound effect.\n\nAs a meta-reference to both science fiction and video game tropes, the device and its function are a constant source of humor in the game. For example, a number of cut-scenes in the game detail the difficulty the crew has in hauling the large device around from planet to planet, level to level, and in one scene, where the Planet Express ship is about to crash, Fry exclaims, &quot;we're going to die!&quot; Bender replied by saying, &quot;So what? We've been dying all game&quot;.\n\n== Inconsistencies ==\nThe device is always found somewhere at the beginning of each level, suggesting that the player will return to this point if they die. However, each level features a number of &quot;checkpoints&quot; along the way, where re-spawning players actually appear. Additionally, some missions in the game are spread across multiple levels (usually on the same planet and controlling the same character). However, the Reanimator only appears at the beginning of the first of these connected levels.\n\nThe Reanimator has a dial with three settings &quot;Fry&quot;, &quot;Bender&quot;, and &quot;Leela&quot;, indicating the three playable characters in the game. In fact, Leela learns that she is a playable character only after she is shown her name printed on the dial.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein Albert Einstein]'s famous statements that it would be mathematically impossible to travel faster than light seem to have held up throughout the 3rd millennia, and although in [[2208]] the scientific community allegedly raised the speed of light so that they could go faster, the problem that one cannot go faster than the speed of light remains.\n\nThe solution was the dark matter engine, which doesn't move the ship through the universe, but instead moves the universe around it at phenomenal speeds and is thereby able to cover incredible distances in a relatively short period of time.\n[[Category:Technology]]\n[[Category:Inventions]]"

Versions are available for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, both of which use cell-shading technology. A version for the Nintendo GameCube was planned but later canceled due to a belief that the show's popularity was too limited.\n\nReleased: August 1, 2003\n\n== Storyline ==\nRecurring antagonist [[Mom]] buys [[Planet Express]] for cynical reasons and the team of [[Fry]], [[Bender]], [[Leela]], and [[Zoidberg]] must thwart her evil plot to take over the universe.\n\nAs the game begins, Professor [[Farnsworth's Killbots|Farnsworth]] has sold the company [[Planet Express]] to [[Mom]], after realizing the company has been losing money. With her purchase of [[Planet Express]], [[Mom]] now owns over 50% of the planet [[Earth]], and becomes its supreme ruler, taking all [[humans]] for slaves and instituting a curfew with 'hoverbot death troopers' patrolling the streets. [[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory|Fry]], [[Leela's Homeworld|Leela]], [[Bender's Big Score|Bender]] and [[Farnsworth's Killbots|Farnsworth]] attempt to escape [[Earth]] but the ship is broken and scorched so whilst the others repair the ship, [[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory|Fry]] finds a hammer. However, when the two ton pile of steel and junk the hammer was supporting falls on him, he is killed. He is brought back to life by the Professor's [[Reanimator|Re-Animator]] and finds all the Professor's tools to fix the ship. Alas, the professor couldn't fix the [[dark matter]] engine so [[Fry &amp; the Slurm Factory|Fry]] must go to the pawn shop and reclaim the back-up engine via the [[Sewers of New New York|Sewers]], [[Old New York Subway]], [[Old New York]] and two levels in [[New New York]]. Once he does so they escape earth with the R[[re-animator|e-Animator]] and the railgun the professor pawned the back-up engine for.\n\n[[Mom]]'s plan is bigger than the mere conquest of [[Earth]]; she plans to turn the planet [[Earth]] into a gigantic warship to conquer the universe. However, in order to move the entire planet off its orbit, she requires a large [[Dark Matter Engine|dark matter engine]], that only Professor [[Hubert Farnsworth]] knows how to build. She captures the [[Planet Express ship]] in a tractor beam from a scrapyard on a desert asteroid. [[Bender's Big Score|Bender]] escapes with the [[Reanimator|Re-Animator]] and shuts down the tractor beam. [[Mom]]'s ship, in the shape of [[Mom]]'s head, captures the [[Planet Express ship]] in its mouth and [[Mom]] and her sons board the [[Planet Express ship]]. They cut off the Professor's [[head in a jar|head]] and put it in a jar before hurling the [[Planet Express Ship]] into the sun.\n\nIn a twist, the [[Sun]] actually has a habitable surface, where the Sun People live in fear of the Mighty Sun God, that has killed much of the star's population and created an undead army out of their bones. Leela defeats him, in exchange for dark matter to fuel up the ship, and the crew heads to the planet [[Bogad]], Dagobah spelled backwards minus two letters, home of Professor Farnsworth's mentor [[Adoy]], Yoda spelled backwards, presumed to be the only person capable of hatching a plan to solve the situation. As the crew journeys to [[Bogad]], [[Mom]] succeeds in powering up the [[Earth]]'s [[Dark matter engine|Dark Matter engine]] and proceeds to destroy nearby planets.\n\nOn [[Bogad]], the crew meets [[Adoy]], who reveals he's invented a time machine capable of sending them back in time and stop [[Mom]] before she became unstoppable. The ship and crew travel into the past but arrive completely out of control, crashing the broken, scorched ship inside the [[Planet Express hangar]] with not much time left to prevent the original sale of [[Planet Express]]. They leave in their original ship, the broken ship becoming a time paradox.\n\nThe crew arrives at [[Momcorp]] just in time to prevent the sale, however [[Mom]] forces them to fight the robot [[Destructor]]. The crew manages to defeat him, but then they are crushed and killed. Professor [[Hubert Farnsworth]] has a face-off with Mom and then returns to [[Planet Express]] to give his employees some good news. The cutscene shown at the end is actually the first cutscene from the beginning. The game ends the way it began, returning to Level 1 and completing the circle in the timeline, thus creating an infinite parodox loop.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n=== Overview ===\nIn '''''Futurama''''', the player controls each of four playable characters on different levels designed for using just one of the characters at once. Most levels include a combination of fighting, jumping, and some puzzle-solving. Making use of each of these characters and their abilities, the player furthers the story along by unlocking interstitial cut scenes that provide more information about the story for the player.\n\nIn addition to these playable characters, many other characters from the series make cameo appearances, as well as new characters being introduced for the first time.\n\n=== Special items ===\nAs well as the levels being character specific, each character is also provided with items, health pick-ups, and valuables to collect that will help them in some way.\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/futurama Metacritic Review Aggregation]\n*[http://www.futurama-madhouse.com.ar/sounds/game.shtml Sound clips from the game] at [http://www.futurama-madhouse.com.ar/ Futurama Madhouse]\n*[http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/futurama/ Futurama at Gamespot.com]\n\n[[Category:Video games]]"

[Sigh]. A man can dream though. A man can dream...|Hubert J. Farnsworth|Anthology of Interest I}}\n\nA '''Fing-Longer''' was an invention Professor [[Farnsworth]] regretted not inventing. It was similar to a glove, but it had an extended index finger, thus allowing him to use it during mission briefings. It allows him to reach much further to press things than he could have done with his normal hand. He first saw it in a [[What-If Machine|What If?]] scenario but later went on to invent it as he thought it was a good idea.\n\nAn underlying difficulty that the invention of the Fing-Longer creates is whether Professor Farnsworth can properly be said to have invented it if he got the idea from a What-If Machine. The first question is to what extent does external inspiration affect one's claim as inventor. The second question is does another version of one's self count as external inspiration (most likely it does).\n\nA third option is that the fing-longer was invented by someone other than the Professor, hence its existence in other episodes. It may be an invention that the Professor envies, as his statement &quot;so that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer&quot; only tells us that the Professor didn't invent it, not that it had not been invented at all.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n* &quot;[[Anthology of Interest I]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]&quot;\n*''[[Bender's Big Score]]''\n* &quot;[[The Duh-Vinci Code]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Inhuman Torch]]&quot;\n=== Comics ===\n*''[[The Read Menace!]]''\n=== Video games ===\n*''[[Futurama: The Game]]''\n\n[[Category:Technology]]\n[[Category:Inventions]]"

Fry]]. He was also Philip's illegitimate son due to a time-travelling mishap, though he apparently believed his father to have been [[Enos Fry]].\n\nHe was a military man and a veteran of the [[Wikipedia:Vietnam War|Vietnam War]]. He was slightly paranoid about &quot;[[Wikipedia:Commies|Commies]]&quot; and &quot;[[Wikipedia:Y2K|Y2K]]&quot;. He, along with his wife, thought sending Fry to school was a waste of taxpayers money. This was probably correct, as Fry was largely self-taught and had the means to deal with the [[Brainspawn]] many years later.\n\nDuring the episode ''[[Cold Warriors]]'', Philip Fry has multiple flashbacks of his father during an ice-fishing trip and a science fair battle he had with [[Josh Gedgie]]. While Yancy, Sr. seemed to be harsh of Philip, he later reveals that he's only tough on him in order to make him stronger. He mentions that Philip may have to deal with unimaginable problems, unknowingly hinting at Philip's fate, involving him being frozen for 1000 years.\n\n== Traditional Name ==\nThere is a tradition in the Fry family that goes back to the late 1700s, to name the first born son &quot;Yancy&quot;.

Fry]]. In 1947, Fry encountered her as waitress when he, Leela, Dr. Zoidberg, Bender and Prof. Farnsworth traveled back in time.\n\n==Character Description==\nAfter Enos was killed in a house that turned out to be a test site for an atomic bomb, she was consoled by her grandson who Mildred felt reminded her deeply of Enos (unaware that Philip was her own grandson) and asked if he would walk her home. Once there she, grieved over her fiancé and immediately began flirting with Fry, making him uncomfortable. In an effort to distract Mildred, Fry asks her to make him sugar cookies to cheer her up, but Mildred, refusing to be deterred, rips open the top of her dress and thrust her bra covered breasts at him after seductively asking &quot;How about these cookies, sugar?&quot;.\n\nFry was hesitant about having sex with Mildred but got over it, incorrectly reasoning that since he still existed and Enos was dead, Mildred wasn't actually his grandmother. Before he could finish his sentence Mildred quickly kissed him and the two made passionate love on the couch which soon moved to the bedroom. As a result of sleeping with Mildred, Fry conceived his father and became his own grandfather.\n\nThe next morning Fry noticed that Mildred started acting like his own grandmother in his own time, but was out of place as in the 1940s she was an attractive, beautiful and very sexy young woman. She suddenly wore reading glasses and was hard of hearing. It was then that Fry realized that Mildred was in fact his grandmother and in sleeping with her it made him his own grandfather.\n\nPhilip's affair with Mildred was a likely reference to a parody country song ''I'm My Own Grandpa'', where the singer recounts a complex family tree only to say at the end he somehow married his own widowed grandmother. [[Nibbler]] was also aware of what Fry did to Mildred and commented in &quot;[[The Why Of Fry]]&quot; that &quot;the nasty from the past-y&quot; cost him the delta brain wave and thus, his born immunity to the [[Brainspawn]].\n\n== Family Tree ==\n\n Mr. Gleisner──┬──Mrs. Gleisner     [[Philip J.

There is one moment where he told the nibblonians that he is proud of doing &quot;the nasty from the past-y&quot; with his grandmother. The second is when the professor mentions the benefits the forward time travel machine has to offer such as stopping oneself from sleeping with his own grandmother and Fry stating that he wouldn't do that again. \n\n== Appearances ==\n* &quot;[[Roswell that Ends Well]]&quot;\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:One Time Characters]]\n[[Category:Fry family]]\n[[Category:Females]]"

The specimen is green in color and consists of a translucent jelly-like body complete with two feelers and one large eyeball. An adult brain slug is about the size of a fist. \n\n== Symptoms of Possession ==\nA person who has been possessed by a brain slug is most likely to adopt a monotone voice and will do everything in its power to aid the spreading of the brain slug population across the [[universe]]. The easiest way to tell if someone is infected is the Brain Slug mass which sits atop of their head. Although the Brain Slug is in control of the host, the human is still aware of itself and the parasite's presence, which [[Hermes]] referred to as a 'nightmare'. The recommended procedure to deal with a Brain Slug victim is to act natural and switch to a garlic shampoo.\n\nAnother way to avoid being possessed is to wear a helmet. Fortunately, the brain slug is not the most intelligent of creatures and can be removed quite simply without significantly harming the host human's head. Once removed from the afflicted victim's head, the person immediately returns to normal.\n\n== Additional Information ==\n=== The Brain Slug Political Movement ===\nThe Brain Slug Political Movement, or Brain Slug Party, is a political party based on [[Earth]] organized by human beings who have become victims to the parasite. All representatives of the movement are usually under the control of a Brain Slug. Its main political goals include giving high subsidies to the [[Brain Slug Planet]] and attaching a brain slug to 'the working man', and basically every other being that inhabits Earth.\n\n=== Notable Victims ===\nTwo employees of [[Planet Express]] have experienced encounters with the brain slug. Hermes was afflicted in both [[A Head in the Polls]] and [[Raging Bender]]; during the latter episode a slug managed to attach itself to [[Fry]]. In Fry's case the Slug soon died of starvation. This raises some interesting questions about the nature of both a Brain Slug and Fry, including whether a brain slug feeds upon the victims [[Delta brainwave]] to survive, of which Fry lacks. However, it is also possible that Fry is just a common idiot and lacks the mental energy to sustain the needs of an adult brain slug, but it's worth to mention that Fry's stupidity is ''caused'' by his lack of Delta brainwave, so it's still responsible for the Brain slug starvation. In [[Futurama: The Game]], Hermes is once again a victim to the parasite.\n\n=== Character Trivia ===\n*During the Audio Commentary for [[Raging Bender]], [[David X. Cohen]] states that the brain slugs were initially going to fulfill a much different, larger role in the Futurama universe, including inhabiting ceilings and dropping down on unsuspecting victims, making them seem smarter for a time - but eventually growing to inhabit the victims entire head.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n*''[[A Head in the Polls]]''\n*''[[Raging Bender]]''\n=== Comics ===\n*''[[Planet Michelle]]''\n=== Games ===\n*''[[Futurama The Game]]''\n*''Team Fortress 2''\n[[Category:Species]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"

Where's my stabbing knife?!|Roberto}}\n\n'''Roberto''' is a recurring character in ''[[Futurama]]''. He was a [[robot]] who enjoyed stabbing people and objects, as well as robbing banks. He is regarded as being mentally unstable and has been seen in the [[Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots]] multiple times, threatening both patients and doctors with knives, and escaping at least once. His insanity had been cured in ''[[Bender's Game]]'', but suffered a concussion and soon lost all mental aptitude.\n\n== Background ==\nRoberto's history is largely unknown, however, in ''Bender's Game'' he reveals he was built by some engineers who wanted to make an insane robot. He says they failed, but from everyone else's view, it was a major success. During &quot;[[Insane in the Mainframe]]&quot;, he mentions that his mother used to weld him to the wall as a form of punishment, a possible explanation for his insane behaviour. He also can be seen lining up at a sperm bank at one point, likely to rob it.\n\n== Death ==\nIn &quot;[[The Six Million Dollar Mon]]&quot;, Roberto was executed after his latest attack on [[Hermes Conrad]] and [[Labarbara]], attempting to rob them of their skin. After his death, Hermes replaced all his body parts with robotic implants. To become a complete robot, he, [[Professor Farnsworth]] and Bender unknowingly dug up Roberto's grave for a robot brain. Hermes' brain was ultimately placed back in his human body while Roberto's brain was placed in Hermes' robot body. Roberto peeled a piece of Hermes' skin and ate it but melted due to the spiciness of the skin (from years of eating Labarbara's spicy cooking).\n\nIn the episode &quot;[[Stench and Stenchibility]]&quot;, Roberto was apparently rebuilt, as he tried to mug Zoidberg and his new girlfriend.\n\n== Quotes ==\n{{Quote|The first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little.|Roberto, explaining why he attempted to rob the same bank twice}}\n\n{{Quote|Well, well, looks like old Roberto's the focus of attention now.

Each episode consists of a scene that is a pastiche of episodes of the Twilight Zone, or another subject of science fiction. When watching The Scary Door, everyone appears unmoved and Bender has even said, &quot;saw it coming&quot;. This may mean that it is a very predictable television program.\n\n\n\n== Episode 1, featured in the Futurama episode [[A Head in the Polls]] ==\n\nNarrator: You are entering the vicinity of an area adjacent to a location. The kind of place where there might be a monster, or some kind of weird mirror. These are just examples; it could also be something much better. Prepare to enter: The Scary Door.\n\nLast Man: [Walks into library]\n\nNarrator: As per your request, please find enclosed the last man on Earth.\n\nLast Man: Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity! [drops his glasses] It's not fair, it's not fair! [calms down] Wait, my eyes aren't that bad; I can still read the large-print books. [reaches for a book, his eyes fall out] [hysterical] It's not f- [calms down] Well, lucky I know how to read Braille. [He screams as his hands fall off, his tongue then falls out before his head falls off.]\n\nNarrator: Hey, look at that weird mirror..\n\n\n== Episode 2, featured in the Futurama episode [[I Dated A Robot]] ==\n\nNarrator: You are entering the realm which is unusual. Maybe it's magic or contains some kind of monster. The second one. Prepare to enter... The Scary Door. Please send a man 'round back and pick up Clyde Smith, a professional gambler who's about to have an unfortunate accident.\n\nClyde Smith: [Smith is run over by a car, then awakes in a casino. He plays the slot machine and wins] Ha-ha-ha! A casino where I'm winning? That car must've killed me. I must be in heaven!  \n[wins again]\n\nClyde Smith: A casino where I always win. That's boring. I must really be... in HELL!\n\nSebastian Cabot: No, Mr. Smith. You are not in heaven or hell. You are on an airplane!  \n[unrolls the curtains, revealing the airplane windows. A creature sits on the wing of the plane, ripping wires out of it]\n\nClyde Smith: There's a gremlin destroying the plane. You gotta believe me!\n\nSebastian Cabot: Why should I believe you? You're Hitler!  \n[Pulls out a mirror. Clyde's reflection indeed looks like Hitler]\n\nClyde Smith: No!  \n[turns to a woman sitting next to him]\n\nClyde Smith: Eva Braun! Help me!  \n[the woman pulls off a mask, revealing the head of a fly]\n\nClyde Smith: A-a-ah!\n\n\n== Episode 3, featured in the Futurama episode [[Spanish Fry]] ==\n\nNarrator: You're on a scenic route through a state recreational area known as the human mind. You ask a pass-byer for directions, only to find he has no face or something. Suddenly up ahead, a door in the road. You swerve, narrowly avoiding The Scary Door.\n\nScientist: [A mad scientist is seen mixing chemicals] I have combined the DNA of the world's most evil animals to make the most evil creature of them all. [A pod opens flowing with clouds of steam]\n\nNaked Man: [Steps out of pod] Turns out it's man!\n\n== Episode 4, featured in the Futurama comic [[Let's Twist Again]] ==\nNarrator: Imagine, if you will, a three by seven inch wooden frame - a frame that's a gateway to a world of imagination. Wipe your mind on the welcome mat. You're about to enter The Scary Door.\n\n[A man is driving his car.]\n\nNarrator: Meed Brad Thompson, a man on his way home from a boring day at the office.\n\nBrad: Man, I wish something exciting would happen...anything at all.\n\n[A fire truck appears behind him.]\n\nBrad: What's this? A fire truck is trying to pass me? To get to my neighbourhood? I'll bet my neighbour's house is on fire. I'd better speed up if I want to watch that.\n\n[Brad speeds up, parks outside his neighbour's house and gets out of his car.]\n\nMan: Oh... hi Brad, sorry to tell you but...you're on fire!\n\n[And he's right. Brad's lower bit is on fire.]\n\nBrad: Yaaargh!\n\n[Brad burns to a skeleton, which collapses on the floor.]\n\nFireman: We tried to warn him that he was spontaneously combusting, but he drove away from us.\n\nNarrator: Official cause of death, third degree burns...actual cause of death, first degree irony!\n\n== Episode 5, featured in the Futurama movie [[Bender's Game]] ==\n\n\n[[File:Scary_Door_-_T-Rex.jpg|thumb|T-Rex destroying UFO]]\n\nLocation: 13 minutes 39 seconds\n\nNarrator: Imagine if you will, an announcer you can barely understand, he refers to a [mutters], but you're not quite sure what he said. He seems to be eating something, or perhaps he's a little drunk. It's remotely possible that he just said something about the Scary Door.\n\n[A farm is shown. Suddenly, UFOs appear and start shooting everything. The military also suddenly appear to fight the aliens]\n\nPrivate: It's all over! Our guns and bombs are useless against the aliens.\n\nFarmer: The saucers! They's a-crashin'!\n\nNarrator: In the end, it was not guns and bombs that defeated the aliens, but that humblest of all God's creatures, the Tyrannosaurus Rex. [Tyrannosaurus Rex hits down an alien saucer.]\n\n== Episode 6, featured in the Futurama episode [[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]] ==\n\nNarrator: You're taking a vacation from normalcy. The setting, a weird motel where the bed is stained with mystery, and there's also some mystery floating in the pool. Your key card may not open the exercise room because someone smeared mystery on the lock, but it will open.. The Scary Door. Submitted for your Emmy consideration, a popular senator with unpopular ideas.\n\nSenator: There is no such thing as space aliens.\n\nBum: Oh, how can you be so sure them aliens ain't already among us?\n\nSenator: I'll tell you how..because you are one!\n\n== Episode 7, featured in the Futurama episode [[Benderama]] ==\n\nNarrator: Enclosed is a .pdf attachment, a picture of yourself in a boat on a river. It's a river that flows in two directions. Make that three. It's a magic river. That's how. It is flowing down the eerie canal to... ''The Scary Door''. That's ''eerie'' with two ''E''s\n\n[A scientist finishes wielding a robot.]\n\nNarrator: Consider, if you have the energy, Dr. Daniel Zeus, an inventor with a terminal case of the lazies.\n\nDaniel: This robot will do everything for me! Robot, activate yourself and do my research.\n\n[The robot does so. Daniel lies back on a chair.]\n\nDaniel: Ah!\n\n[Later...]\n\nDaniel: Next, assume my social obligations.\n\n[The robot does so. Years later, the scientist is now old and an official enters.]\n\nOfficial: Dr. Daniel Zeus, for a lifetime of scientific achievement, we present this award to...your robot!\n\n[The official gives the robot a trophy.

    "text": "'''All My Circuits''' is a popular soap opera on [[Futurama]], which is often watched by the [[Planet Express crew]]. Like many soap operas, All My Circuits involves [[File:Calculon-2.JPG|thumb|Calculon, the main star of All my Circuits]]a great deal of backstabbing, blackmail, infidelity, and amnesia. Unlike other soap operas, it stars a cast of mainly [[robot]], acting units.\n\n== Main Characters ==\n*[[Calculon]]: The main star of the show.\n*[[Monique]]: Calculon's girlfriend, fiancé, and/or wife (depending on the point in the show). She has also had numerous affairs with others, such as Calculon's other personalities and his half brother Boxy.\n*[[Human Friend]]: Calculon's best friend, he is the show's only human character and therefore is responsible for doing human things (e.g. laughs, learns, loves).\n*[[Boxy]]: Calculon's evil half-brother.\n*[[Antonio Calculon Jr.]]: the son of Calculon and Monique, Antonio was supposed to reveal that Calculon was not his actual father but the acting unit playing him malfunctioned and his replacement decided to go an alternate route.\n*[[Bender#Entertainment|Bender]]: Before stepping down from the role due to pressure from groups like [[Fathers Against Rude Television|F.A.R.T.]], Bender Bending Rodríguez became a sensation on the show after replacing the malfunctioning Antonio Calculon and taking the role in a new direction. Much like the Bender in real life, &quot;Bender&quot;, as Antonio asked to be called, was known for his hard partying, drinking, smoking, and a less-than-ethical worldview.\n*La Perri: Calculon's human pet. \n\n==Known Episodes==\nThis is a list of all known episodes from [[All My Circuits]], their titles are based on conjecture.\n\n=== The Proposal ===\n[[Calculon]] proposes to [[Monique]] while the pair sit in a garden. The ring surprises Monique because it is metric, but Calculon confesses that he has always known. From the cover of nearby bushes, [[Boxy]] secretly watches them making out.\n\nThe scene switches to [[Human Friend]] sitting on a desk laughing as Calculon enters. The Human Friend is surprised because he had thought Calculon was in a coma, but Calculon says that is what he had wanted him to think &quot;with his soft pitiful human brain&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;[[I, Roommate]]&quot;&gt;''[[I, Roommate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;.\n\n=== Calculon's Wedding and Funeral ===\n\nAt Calculon and Monique's wedding, Boxy stops the ceremony with an interrupted objection. Calculon reveals, and then reiterates, a terrible secret from his past (although the shocking secret isn't shown in [[I, Roommate]], he does address Boxy as his half-brother).\n\nLater in the episode, at a funeral [[Preacherbot]] mourns the death of Calculon, when Calculon interrupts the speech to ask if he can give the eulogy&lt;ref name=&quot;[[I, Roommate]]&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.\n\n=== Human Friend in Hospital ===\nIn the hospital, Human Friend apologizes for treating Calculon badly over an argument they had previously had.

The writers intend to have Antonio reveal that Calculon wasn't his real father and that he was fleeing to join robo-banditos in Veracruz, but the [[Bender|new actor]] prompts a re-write to fit his acting abilities.

They are used in a wide variety of roles and environments, as well as often do jobs considered too menial for Humans or other species.\n\n== History ==\n=== The First Millennia ===\n[[File:EarlyRobot.jpg|thumb|left|An Early Model of Robot]]\nThe first robots were crude beings created by [[Human|humanity]] to hеlp with a variety of tasks. The earliest of these robots were created at the end of the 29th century. Over the course of the next millennia robots would come to be a part of Earth culture, to the extent that by 3000 academic institutions offered the subject of Robo-American Studies.\n\nThe birth of a dog\n\n===  ===\nThroughout the centuries robots remained &quot;slow moving, stiff, and a little on the uptight side.&quot; But on October 17th, [[2928]] [[Hubert J. Farnsworth]], working for [[MomCorp]], discovered that by sacrificing fuel efficiency he could create a &quot;bigger, sportier robot.&quot; It didn't meet emission standards, but MomCorp was able to get around this by marketing it as a &quot;Sport Utility Robot&quot; classified as a light truck.\n\n=== Environmental Consequences ===\nThe modern robot is fueled by alcohol and gives off greenhouse gasses primarily through flaming burps, which eventually drove Earth to the brink of destruction via global warming. Though [[President Nixon]] and [[Ogden Wernstrom|Dr. Wernstrom]] plotted to destroy all robots to save the planet, the Earth was saved when [[Farnsworth]] had all the robots vent their gases straight up at once, thereby moving Earth further from the sun and cooling it.\n\n=== The Future of Earth's Robots ===\nIn 3004 [[MomCorp|Mom's Friendly Robot Company]] released a new model of robot known as [[Robot 1-X]]. Unlike earlier models, Robot 1-X doesn’t malfunction and has a more friendly personality. Perhaps in response to the near destruction of Earth by robot-generated greenhouse gases earlier that year, Robot 1-X also ran on pollution and emitted fresh oxygen. The shift to the new model was neither immediate nor easy: many existing robots needed to have their programming upgraded to be compatible with the new model and the majority of Earth’s robots remain the old, rude, polluting models. Ironically, should Robot 1-X clean up Earth's pollution, the Earth will actually be cooler than it was originally due to the increased distance from the sun. This may help to explain the relative rarity of Robot 1-X's.\n\n== Robotic Physiology ==\nAlthough robots differ in their composition and function, there are several generalizations that can be made that applies to many robots:\n\n=== Composition ===\nMost robots appear to be made of metallic minerals/compounds (i.e. iron, titanium, steel, [[dolomite]]), but there are also examples of robots made of wood and wax.\n\n===Senses===\nIt is stated that robots have 8 senses, including Smision, but do not possess the sense of taste.\n\n=== Antenna ===\nRobots all seem to have an antenna someplace on their body, but the reason for this is unclear. They seem to be able to pick up and disrupt radio signals unconsciously and in some cases even project their thoughts to other radio devices (such as a cellular telephone). [[Mom]] revealed that she has all her robots fitted with one so that she can control them using a [[Universal Robot Controller|universal robot controller]]. Several times it is also stated that it is used as a male reproductive organ.\n\n=== Alcohol Consumption ===\nRobots run on alcohol (apparently ethanol), which recharges their fuel cells. When they don't drink, they suffer symptoms similar to those experienced by organics who have imbibed too much alcohol, such as loss of balance, light-headedness and a thick patch of rust around the mouth, similar to 5 o'clock shadow, but called 5 o'clock rust.\n\n=== Death ===\n&lt;p style=&quot;border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;According to Leela, a Robot can be destroyed by hearing a logical paradox, what makes their A.I.'s collapse. On the other hand, the most recent made robots (including the Bending Units) had backups, so their &quot;minds&quot; don't die with their bodies. It is also revealed in [[The Thief of Baghead]] that food coloring is the most poisonous substance known to robots and will kill them almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n===After-Life===\nUnder certain circumstances (for example a successful suicide attempt, or when the robot's body is buried too close to discarded electronics) a robot's software can be exported to the wireless network shared by all machinery, even if that robot has no back-up unit. In this case, the robot's essence becomes stuck in an &quot;infinite loop&quot; which is inescapable without the intervention of either the [[Robot Devil]] or [[Robot God]]. When in this state, the robot's essence cannot affect physical matter except for electronic machinery. A device called a &quot;sacramental firewall&quot; however can be used to keep the &quot;robot ghost&quot; from coming closer than 10 feet to it. (It also kills cats.) There is some ambiguity as to whether there are other types of ghosts in the Futurama universe/multiverse-in [[The Honking]] it is stated that the last Ghost had died hundreds of years prior, but in [[Proposition Infinity]] it is clear that ghosts are legally recognized entities with the right to marry horses.\n\n== Robotic Culture ==\n=== Vice ===\nLike any society, robots have many vices that certain segments of the population engage in. Examples of such vices include: robot porn, stripperbots, hookerbots, as well as the smoking of cigars and/or cigarettes (to look cool).\n==== Jacking-On ====\nPerhaps the most controversial vice in robot society is the abuse of electricity. Jacking-on, as it's called, involves the channeling of large amounts of electricity through a robot’s processors, resulting in a psychedelic experience. The experience is highly addictive and may lead to decreased energy levels and/or residual electrical activity in the eyes. The name is a thinly veiled euphemism for masturbation, which can be referred to as &quot;jacking off.&quot;\n===Spark===\nAn analog to drugs for robots which is illegal to possess or use.  In appearance it is similar to a crack pipe with a plasma globe on the end.  Its use has a tendency to cause a robot's eyes to turn red.\n\n=== Religion ===\nRobots also have organized religion, but it is unclear how widespread these beliefs are.\nIt is known that  there are &quot;good books.&quot; It is also known that a preacher is [[Reverend Lionel Preacherbot]].\n==== Robotology ====\nOne of the more radical robot religions is Robotology, which holds its members to a strict contract not to engage in any behavior considered taboo among the faith (see the Vice section above). Should the contract be broken, the member would be sent to Robot Hell for eternity.\n&lt;br /&gt;See Also: [[Robotology]]\n===Holidays===\nRobots may or may not actually celebrate several holidays of their own, including Robonadon, Robanzaa(which is a sacred tribute to robot ancestral prototypes that takes the form of a drinking contest) and Robonnukah, the most sacred two weeks (or six and a half weeks, or four weeks for a reform-Robonnukah) on the robot calendar which is celebrated with dancing, drinking from a Robo-kiddish cup, the spinning of the Droidel, as well as wrestling of Fembots with illegal five-speed groins in petroleum oil, which has been used up.\n\n\n=== Robosexuality ===\nBy the standards of humanity, robots tend to be quite active sexually (probably due to the fact that it is &lt;i&gt; primarily &lt;/i&gt; for recreation rather than for reproduction), but relationships between humans and robots are severely discouraged, as well as marriages between the beings were banned on [[Earth]] until the passage of [[Proposition ∞]] in [[3010]]. In [[The Bots and the Bees]] it is revealed that robots can procreate sexually as a means of making up for the inability of Momcorp to make enough robots via traditional methods.\n\n== Varieties ==\n=== Fembots ===\nA '''Fembot''' is a female version of a robot.\n\n=== Children Robots ===\nWhile robots generally age quite rapidly by human standards (Bender aged in hours for example, another being his son Ben, who ages at 364.2 times faster as a human ), some robots remain children for longer periods of time (such as [[Tinny Tim]]). It is unclear why robots would need children besides child actors, but they continue to be built just the same.\n\n=== Robotic Variations By Function ===\nRobots have expanded beyond their original programming to fulfill many functions, some of which would not seem to need to be fulfilled (such as homeless robots or criminal units). The following is a short list of different functions or occupation that robots fulfill as well as three or four examples.\n\n==== Acting Units ====\n*[[Boxy]]\n*[[Calculon]]\n*[[Monique]]\n\n==== Bending Units ====\n*[[Angleyne]]\n*[[Bender]]\n*[[Flexo]]\n\n==== Children Units ====\n*Junior\n*[[Tinny Tim]]\n*[[Bender's First Born Son]]\n*[[Ben Rodríguez]]\n\n==== Civil Servants ====\n*[[Computer Judge]]\n*[[URL]]\n\n==== Combat Droids (including [[Ultimate Robot Fighting League|URFL]] fighters) ====\n*[[Billionairebot]]\n*[[Chain Smoker]]\n*[[The Clearcutter]]\n*[[Destructor]]\n*[[The Foreigner]]\n*[[The Gender Bender]]\n*[[Killbots]]\n\n==== Fratbots ====\n*[[Gearshift]]\n*[[Fatbot]]\n*[[Oily]]\n\n==== Medical Units ====\n*[[Dr. Perceptron]]\n*[[iHawk]]\n*[[Nurse Ratchet]]\n\n==== Religious/Holiday ====\n*[[Kwanzabot]]\n*[[Preacherbot]]\n*[[Robot Devil]]\n*[[Santa Claus Robot]]\n*[[Robot God]]\n\n==== Robot Mafia/ Criminal Units ====\n*[[Andrew]]\n*[[Clamps]]\n*[[Donbot]]\n*[[Roberto]]\n*[[Joey Mousepad]]\n\n==== Salesrobots/Robots in Service Industry ====\n*[[Chainsmoker]]\n*[[Frankie]]\n*[[iZac]]\n*[[Malfunctioning Eddie]]\n\n==== Socialite Units ====\n*[[Billionaire Bot]]\n*[[Countess de la Roca]]\n*[[Hedonismbot]]\n[[Category:Technology]]\n[[Category:Robots|*]]\n[[Category:Inventions]]"

They all speak with [[Wikipedia:Yiddish|Yiddish accents]], possibly because of these appendages. They аlso possess a fin-like crest that appears when they are enraged or aroused, as well as an ink gland similar to the [[Earth]] [[Wikipedia:Octopus|octopus]]. They have been known to use their ink while writing letters that require a personal touch.\n\nDecapodians also have a strange gland that produces foul odors when they are bored. Upon ingesting dirt, they cough up a kind of pearl, not unlike clams. They must also have gills as they are capable of breathing underwater.\n\nThey also seem capable of eating and digesting almost anything even vaguely organic, from human food, to garbage, all the way to ''wood''. They also have freshwater and saltwater stomachs which they can vomit separately from. They can apparently go for several days without eating. Interestingly, they can still survive and stand upright without their shell, suggesting an endoskeleton as well as a shell intended simply for defensive purposes.\n\nInternally, Decapodians are cold blooded and have a number of redundant organs, such as four hearts, that may be removed. Apparently, Decapodians are capable of surviving multiple dismemberments, as Zoidberg demonstrated in [[Roswell that Ends Well]], where he has several of his organs surgically removed after a series of vivasections. He gets them back and reinserts them later with no long-term consequences.\n\nThey are also shown being able to survive missile attack in [[A Taste of Freedom]].\n\n==Life Cycle==\n\n[[File:DecapodianLifeCycle.jpeg|thumb|left|The Decapodian Life Cycle ]]Decapodians mature through a long series of larval stages before attaining the humanoid, fully grown form. Apart from this complex life cycle, they have very long lifespans. They begin life as a small immobile creature from[[File:ZoidbergTeenager.jpg|thumb|One of Zoidbergs earlier forms]] which asexually fragmented siblings can separate, each with their own distinct personality. A later stage resembles a parasitic lamprey, followed by a large clam inside which the head is visible. The next oldest form resembles a trilobite. Other stages included an urchin-like state, and later a cuttlefish-like appearance. A prominent Decapodian, [[John A. Zoidberg|Dr. Zoidberg]], reverted through all of these early &quot;larval&quot; life cycle stages of his species after being exposed to a youth tar.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]&quot;&gt;''[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]''&lt;/ref&gt; When Decapodians mate, they quickly die off, leaving their young to grow without parents to guide them.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?]]&quot;&gt;''[[Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIt is implied though, that some Decapodians refrain from mating to help keep their civilization running; they either adopt young into their family or only certain members of families mate so the young do not have to become part of a new family. Zoidberg has revealed during flashbacks to have been raised by a female he calls his mother. It may be that when the Decapodians die, their bodies turn into coral, starting their lives over again and making more of their species.\n\n==Members==\n*[[John A.

When they saw Fry (who, due to temporary head trauma, bore a resemblance to a Neanderthal) kissing [[Leela]], they thought that the period of discrimination was over.

The Omicronians in the year 3000 enjoyed watching the show, which was broadcasted on Omicron Persei 8 via television signals originating from Earth, but were enraged when the show surceased abruptly during a climactic scene. They subsequently invaded Earth and demanded to see the ending of the show, and if it wasn't for [[Philip J. Fry]]'s expertise in television programing, they would have laid Earth's cities to waste with their anti-monument lasers.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[When Aliens Attack]]&quot;&gt;''[[When Aliens Attack]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n\nIn a parallel universe in which life was more like video games, the Omicronians headed a force of [[Wikipedia:Space_Invaders|Invaders (possibly from space)]] that defeated Earth's defense forces to demand the planet's quarters so that they could do their laundry.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Anthology of Interest II]]&quot;&gt;''[[Anthology of Interest II]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Biology ==\nThe Omicronians mating process can be dangerous to bystanders, and it is highly recommended that one stays outside a 500 meter radius during the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Spanish Fry]]&quot;&gt;''[[Spanish Fry]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The sex organs of the males are located in their horns. The larger the horns are, the more attractive they are to the females. Once born, the Omicronian raise their young, which resemble fried shrimp, by depositing millions of them into large pits on nursery planets (though they watch over them from a distance with security cameras). When their young grow up, they eat their mothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Problem with Popplers]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Problem with Popplers]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThey have great strength and durability and are more technologically advanced than humans. Their mouths are big enough to swallow adult humans whole.\n\n== Relations with Earthicans ==\nOmicronians have an interesting relationship with the planet Earth. On several occasions the Omicronians have invaded Earth for a variety of reasons, and they don't understand the Earthican cultural norms such as chalky-valentine hearts.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Love and Rocket]]&quot;&gt;''[[Love and Rocket]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDespite this, they seem to have a great affinity for other aspects of human pop culture enjoying Earth sitcoms that many humans don't particularly like, apparently because they can relate to the characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[When Aliens Attack]]&quot;&gt;''[[When Aliens Attack]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly interesting because Omicronians are unable to distinguish between humans, or even the various primates native to Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Problem with Popplers]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Problem with Popplers]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis appears to be the case even after it was discovered that the Earthicans had eaten over 198 billion of their young: After the [[Planet Express Crew]] came across a nursery planet, they brought back shiploads of what they assumed were simply delicious snacks, and sold them through [[Fishy Joe's]] as [[Popplers]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;[[The Problem with Popplers]]&quot;&gt;''[[The Problem with Popplers]]''&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Appearances ==\n*&quot;[[When Aliens Attack]]&quot;\n*&quot;[[The Problem With Popplers]]&quot;\n*&quot;[[Anthology of Interest II]]&quot;\n*&quot;[[Love And Rocket]]&quot;\n*&quot;[[Spanish Fry]]&quot;\n*&quot;[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]&quot;\n\n==Trivia==\nMost Omicronians appear to be named based on their occupation; namely those that have the suffix &quot;er&quot;.

She lived with her husband and sons in a trashed house in Brooklyn.\n\n==Character Description==\n===Appearance===\nMrs. Fry is redhead and she even looks like [[Enos Fry]], her [[Roswell that Ends Well|former]] father-in-law. She often wears casual clothes. Mrs. Fry was likely to be born around 1947 or 1948.  \n\n===Personality===\n[[File:Mother and son.png|thumb|220x220px]]\nMrs. Fry was a terrible mother, often neglecting her sons in favor of watching a football game or playing indoor golf and acting unconcerned with their exploits or their whereabouts. When she gave birth to Fry, she was more concerned with the outcome of a game she was listening to on the radio and when her team won, she said it was the happiest day of her life instead of the newborn baby sitting on her lap. When Fry was frozen in 1999, she was too involved with watching a football game to wonder where Fry went to. She thought that sending Fry to school and searching for him when he went missing was a waste of taxpayers' money. Despite this, Mrs. Fry trully loved her children, as seen in &quot;Luck of the Fryish&quot;, when she admits that she does miss Fry very much after he dissapeared. Also, in &quot;D'uh Vinci Code&quot;, it's reveled that Mrs. Fry is one of the very few characters to be aware of Fry's qualities and adviced him that, regardless of how dumb or ugly he might be, he's good-hearted and that's what matters, which shows that she was far wiser than what her neglicence antics suggested. She also has been seen dreaming of Fry in Game of Tones after his disappearance showing that she really loved Fry.\n\n== Biography ==\nShe married Mr. Fry before 1972, which was when their first son is born, they named him Yancy as every Fry since the American Revolution. In 1974, she gave birth to her second child, Philip. Due to a complicated time travel paradox, Mrs. Fry is also Philip's daughter-in-law and her husband's paternal grandmother.

In [[Put Your Head On My Shoulders]], he is seen standing outside Bender's dating service for the miserably lonely. In [[Planet Michelle|the #34 comic]], he is shown using speed-dating, and talks briefly to Amy, who comments that he seems a nice guy, but she already has a boyfriend.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*Larry and his brothers are similar to the Three Stooges, with Larry being most like Larry Fine.\n*As of [[Bender's Game]] it is canon that Larry is approximately 37 years old.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]\n[[Category:Photo Pop Characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Wernstrom family]]"

He is the most like his mother in personality, with deeply devious and malicious tendencies. He has on multiple occasions abused his younger brothers. In his mother's absence, he takes charge of the situation. What keeps him in line is his apparent Oedipus Complex - he has an unhealthy admiration for his psychotic mother, despite her regular abuse of him, and has even admitted that some day, he wishes to marry a woman like her.\n\nDespite Walt's supposed intelligence, the plans he concocts are markedly ridiculous, such as impersonating [[Mr. Panucci]] to elicit information from Fry, and having the trio pose as owl exterminators to get the anti-backwards crystal when he knows absolutely nothing about owls or their extermination. They only work because it's Fry the plans are mostly directed at.\n\nAnother example of Walt's childishness is shown in the episode &quot;[[Mother's Day]]&quot;. When he learns that Professor [[Farnsworth]] is the man who broke Mom's heart, like a child whose parents have separated, he assumes that bringing Farnsworth and Mom back together should be a simple task that will make her happy and thus everything will be alright again.\n\n== Trivia ==\n[[File:Walt.jpg|thumb|Walt]]\n*He and his brothers are similar to ''[[Wikipedia:The Three Stooges|The Three Stooges]]'', with Walt being Moe.\n*His voice shares a noticeable resemblance to [[wikipedia:Vincent Price|Vincent Price]].\n*Walt is a major boss in the ''Futurama'' video game.\n*As of ''[[Bender's Game]]'', it is canon that Walt is approximately 39 years old.\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]\n[[Category:Photo Pop Characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Wernstrom family]]"

He speaks in a stereotypically moronic voice, and is often found saddled with the worst tasks by his brothers, being bullied into wearing Mom's bra, and playing the part of Pamela Anderson's body for her head in a jar. His immaturity means he gets disgusted easy, and he has a tendency to repeat what he hears without full comprehension, for example: in [[Bender's Game]], Igner repeats the phrase &quot;We're owl exterminators&quot; twice, and pronounces exterminators wrong.\n\nIn [[Bender's Game]], Igner helps Fry, Leela and Farnsworth escape his pursuing brothers, by denying that he had seen anybody to Walt. However, while everybody else was going along with the Dungeons and Dragons/Lord of the Rings parody, Igner's alternate reality persona got confused and pulled out a lightsaber, and started parodying Star Wars.\n\nIt was revealed in [[Bender's Game]] that Igner is the son of Professor [[Farnsworth]], making him the distant nephew of [[Fry]] and half-brother of [[Cubert Farnsworth|Cubert]], while his brothers have so far been assumed as the sons of Mom and [[Wernstrom]].\n==Trivia==\n*In [[Bender's Game]], Igner's age is established to be approximately 35 years old—but according to [[Mother's Day]], Mom has not seen Professor [[Farnsworth]] in 70 years.

The movie ends with Calculon handing in his resignation as vice-president to his father on top of the white house. His father refusеs to accept it and turns around, falling off a ledge.

In spite of his love for his clamps, in [[Bender Gets Made]], when they are needed, he is antagonized by Joey Mousepad when Joey suggests Clamps actually uses them. In The Silence Of The Clamps, he starts to work in Planet Express after Bender is forced to go into the witness protection program.

The atmosphere is composed of a thick dark-grey cloud which appears to cover most of the planet. The atmosphere is breathable by biological creatures. Landscape features show a wind-torn and water-eroded surface of sedimentary rock. The flora of Chapek 9 include a dark red plant which resembles bamboo with orange shoots at the top. Another plant of note would be a large three-level mushroom. Fauna is not encountered during the [[Planet Express crew]]'s visit to Chapek 9, but could exist. The anti-human laws were very strict, human hunts were held daily at 5 o'clock and violators wеre executed on sight. As a result, there was no tourism besides traveling robots. Chapek 9 became a member of the [[Democratic Order of Planets]] (D.O.O.P).\n\nThe [[Computer Judge]] deals out the punishments for crimes and sentences all [[human]]s to death.\n\n==The Daily Human Hunt==\n\nHuman hunts are held daily at &quot;5 o'clock&quot;. They commence with a special alarm sound. All robots immediately make their way to gather in front of The Mayor for a speech. The penalty for capture appears to be death. The hunt itself appears to be rather superficial. The hunters' tactics are to group together and lift boulders, or bash the flora.\n\nGiant rat traps are also used and checked by the hunters during the human hunt. The bait in one trap was a large block of butter and a sign.\n\nThere had been 145999 unsuccessful daily hunts in a row. The 146000th human hunt, ends with [[Fry]] and [[Leela]] being captured by the Mayor. If there are 365 days per year on Chapek 9, then it has been 400 years.\n\n==The Lug Nut Shortage==\n\nDuring the Planet Express crew's visit to Chapek 9, there was a lug nut shortage.  The robots, of course, blamed humans.  Their minds were changed after the crew dropped off lug nuts after they had been on trial for being humans.   \n\n\n== Appearances ==\n* &quot;[[Fear of a Bot Planet]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[Free Will Hunting]]&quot;\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nThe name of Chapek 9 is a reference to Josef Čapek, a Czech artist, painter and writer, who invented the word robot in the first place.

He was in attendance at the Planet Express 100th Delivery Party, where he is concerned that the orgy pit be buttered and scraped, and he eventually prepared to settle down and marry a nice house in the suburbs but at the bachelor party a nuclear stripper-bot suffered a catastrophic melt-down, and he was the only survivor of the accident.\n\nWhen most of Bender's body was Bot-jacked and sold for parts in a robot chop-shop operation, Hedonismbot purchased the &quot;Robo-dong&quot; (aka the Antenna) at The Beast With Two Bucks smut shop (where a toilet cam captured his image) and used it for &quot;...anything and everything.&quot;  When the Planet Express Crew visited him to retrieve the part, they are shown walking through a pleasure dungeon with him which is populated by both humans and robots, and Leela calls him &quot;Senator.&quot;\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n*''[[Crimes of the Hot]]''\n*''[[Bend Her]]''\n*''[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]''\n*''[[Proposition Infinity]]''\n*''[[The Late Philip J.

    "text": "The animated science fiction television program [[Futurama]] makes a number of satirical and humorous references to '''religion''', including inventing several fictional religions which are explored in certain episodes of the series.\n\n== Fictional religions ==\n=== Robotology ===\n\nFuturama's satiric scourging of science fiction includes several brilliant brutalizations of its many fictional religions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concord.wikia.com/wiki/Religion Fictional Religions in Science Fiction].&lt;/ref&gt; The episode &quot;[[Hell Is Other Robots]]&quot; centers around [[Bender]] becoming addicted to high-voltage electricity, then discovering the religion of '''Robotology''' to help him break the habit. Sermons are conducted at the Temple of Robotology by the [[Reverend Lionel Preacherbot]], a character whose mannerisms draw heavily on typical inner-city African-American pastor stereotypes.&lt;ref name=&quot;gospel02&quot; /&gt; The name Robotology is a spoof of Scientology,&lt;ref name=&quot;gospel02&quot;&gt;Pinsky, Mark &quot;The Gospel According to the Simpsons&quot; (2001), Westminster John Knox Press, isbn=0-664-22419-9, pp.158-159&lt;/ref&gt; and according to series creator [[Matt Groening]] he received a call from the Church of Scientology concerned about the use of a similar name.&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2003), [[Futurama]] season 1 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;[[Hell Is Other Robots]]&quot;, 20th Century Fox, &quot;I did get a call from a Scientologist who had somehow gotten hold of the script.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:200px-Resistor symbol America.svg.png|thumb|right|200px|The symbol of Robotology is based on the symbol for a resistor used on schematic electrical circuit diagrams.]]Robotology has a holy text, referred to as ''The Good Book 3.0'' and stored on a 3.5&quot; floppy diskette. Two symbols of the religion are shown in the episode. The first is a zig-zag line with a circle at either end, based on the symbol used for resistors on circuit diagrams.&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen01&quot;&gt;Cohen, David X. (2003) [[Futurama]] season 1 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;[[Hell Is Other Robots]]&quot;, 20th Century Fox, &quot;Their symbol is a resistor, also, for anyone who knows electronics.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRobots who accept Robotology are expected to abstain from behavior such as smoking, pornography, stealing, abusing electricity, and alcohol. Consuming alcohol is usually necessary to power a robot's fuel cells, but this episode establishes that mineral oil is an acceptable substitute. Sinners are punished by condemnation to '''Robot Hell''', located under an abandoned amusement park in South Jersey. The punishments in Robot Hell are similar to the levels and rationale which are portrayed in Dante's ''The Divine Comedy'', specifically the Inferno.&lt;ref name=&quot;gospel02&quot; /&gt;\n\nRobot Hell is controlled by the [[Robot Devil]]. He is bound by the &quot;Fairness in Hell Act of 2275&quot;, allowing anyone who can defeat him in a fiddle contest to go free, as well as win a golden fiddle, a reference to the song ''The Devil Went Down to Georgia''.&lt;ref name=&quot;gospel02&quot; /&gt;\n\n=== Robot Judaism ===\n\nThe episode &quot;[[Future Stock]]&quot; introduces Robot Judaism in a scene where [[Fry]] and [[Dr. Zoidberg]], seeking free food, sneak into a &quot;Bot Mitzvah&quot; celebration (a spoof of the Bat Mitzvah). As a joke about Kashrut's proscriptions against shellfish, Zoidberg was not allowed in. At the Bot Mitzvah, Fry asks a Jewish robot if they don't believe in Robot Jesus, to which the robot replies, &quot;We believe he was built, and that he was a very well-programmed robot, but he wasn't our Messiah&quot;. A banner written in Hebrew reads &quot;Today you are a robot&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/futuramavol3.php Ryan, David &quot;Futurama: Volume Three&quot; accessed 2007-10-28]&lt;/ref&gt; referencing the traditional Jewish belief that a boy becomes a man on his Bar Mitzvah.\n\nAn earlier episode, &quot;[[Fear of a Bot Planet]]&quot; also suggested a connection between robots and Judaism, where Bender invents the holiday of &quot;Robannukah&quot; (correlating to Judaism's Hannukah) as an excuse to avoid work, but it is not stated this is actually a Robot Jewish festival.\n\n=== Other fictional religions ===\n\nPassing references are made to other religions, though these are not explored in any detail. In the episode &quot;[[Hell Is Other Robots]]&quot;, [[Professor Farnsworth]] complains about Bender's devotion to Robotology, asking: &quot;Why couldn't he have joined a mainstream religion, like Oprahism or Voodoo?&quot;.\n\nThe episode &quot;[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]&quot; presents the situation of a television show becoming elevated to the status of a religion in the form of the &quot;Church of Trek&quot;, where devotees of ''Star Trek'' worship the characters and attend services dressed as officers and aliens from the show.\n\n[[File:Futurama - First Amalgamated Church.jpg|thumb|right|The logo of the First Amalgamated Church, featuring symbols of several present-day religions.]]\nThe '''First Amalgamated Church''', a mix of several mainstream 21st century religions is featured briefly in several episodes. The church and one of its priests, [[Father Changstien el Gamahl]], are introduced in the episode &quot;[[Godfellas]]&quot;. Father Changstien el Gamahl reappears in &quot;[[The Sting]]&quot; at Fry's funeral service, and in ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'' at Lars and Leela's wedding. In the last of these appearances, the belief system of the First Amalgamated Church is revealed to include agnostic beliefs, the Father beginning the service with the words: &quot;We are gathered here before one or more gods or fewer....&quot;\n\n== References to existing religions ==\n\nAside from inventing religions, the writers of ''Futurama'' also make references to established faiths.\n\nIn the episode &quot;[[When Aliens Attack]]&quot;, Earth is invaded by Omicronians demanding to see the season finale of ''Single Female Lawyer'', a television show which was accidentally knocked off the air 1,000 years earlier by [[Fry]]. [[Professor Farnsworth]] explains that the show no longer exists because most video tapes from that era were destroyed during the Second Coming of Jesus in the year 2443. [[Ken Keeler]], the writer of the episode, considered this joke one of the most blasphemous lines in the show, because it suggested that the Second Coming had been and gone and life on Earth had carried on much as before.&lt;ref&gt;Keeler, Ken (2003), [[Futurama]] season 1 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;[[When Aliens Attack]]&quot;, 20th Century Fox, &quot;...what I like to think is the most sacrilegious joke ever put in the series about the Second Coming of Jesus already having happened and apparently life going on as usual afterwards.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn several occasions, [[Professor Farnsworth]] makes references to &quot;Zombie Jesus&quot;, usually invoking the name as profanity. These exclamations are usually cut for syndication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsu.edu/necrofile/gospel24.htm Pulliam, June &quot;Sweet Zombie Jesus! This Theological Study of The Undead Won’t Have You Using Any Names in Vain&quot;, accessed 2007-10-28]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAnother undead figure, Chanukah Zombie, first mentioned in the episode &quot;[[A Tale of Two Santas]]&quot;, makes an appearance in ''[[Bender's Big Score]]''. He teams up with [[Robot Santa]] and [[Kwanzaa Bot]] to fight alien scam artists who have seized possession of planet Earth. His weapons are themed around Jewish symbols and artifacts, including explosive dreidels and a TIE Fighter (a reference to ''Star Wars''; Mark Hamill supplies Chanukah Zombie's voice) adorned with Stars of David and a menorah.\n\nThe [[decapodians]] speek in Yiddish accents, and zoidberg often says Hebrew words like 'l'chaim' and 'mazel tov', these two languages are spoken by many Jews.\n\nCatholicism is shown to still exist in some form in the 31st century, and seems to have spread to non-human races, as the show makes several references to &quot;[[The Space Pope]]&quot;; in the opening titles of &quot;[[Hell is Other Robots]]&quot; (suggesting the show has been &quot;Condemned by the Space Pope&quot;); in &quot;[[A Bicyclops Built for Two]]&quot;, with Bender's rhetorical question &quot;Is the Space Pope reptilian?&quot;; and in &quot;[[I Dated a Robot]]&quot;, in an endorsement at the end of an educational film (&quot;Brought to you by the Space Pope&quot;). In the last of these, a graphic displays a picture of the Space Pope as a reptilian alien in Papal vestments, encircled by the words ''Crocodylus pontifex''. In the episode &quot;[[Fry Am the Egg Man]]&quot;, Farnsworth says &quot;Now, if there are any catholics out there&quot;, when discussing the Latin scientific name of an alien creature Fry adopted.\n\n== General themes ==\n\nThe episode &quot;[[Godfellas]]&quot; explores several religious themes, though without explicitly referencing or parodying any particular religion. Bender is accidentally cast adrift in space and unwittingly becomes a deity figure to a race of tiny people ([[Shrimpkins]]) living on an asteroid that impacts his body. Bender attempts to answer their prayers, but ends up harming the Shrimpkins. Meanwhile the Shrimpkins who have migrated to Bender's backside, out of his sight, grow frustrated that their prayers go entirely unanswered. Eventually the two factions of Shrimpkins wipe one another out in a miniature nuclear war.\n\nAfter Bender's unsuccessful attempt at deityhood, he encounters a deity-like entity in space. During the conversation between them, the episode touches on the ideas of predestination, prayer, and the nature of salvation in what Mark Pinsky referred to as a theological turn to the episode which may cause the viewer to need &quot;to be reminded that this is a cartoon and not a divinity school class&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gospel02&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinsky |first=Mark |title=The Gospel According to the Simpsons. Bigger and possibly even Better! edition |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-664-23265-8 |pages=229–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the conversation, Bender's questions still have not been fully answered, and he is left wanting more from the voice than it has given him.&lt;ref name=&quot;gospel02&quot;/&gt; The character/entity has returned, albeit briefly, in the first of the direct-to-DVD installments, ''[[Bender's Big Score]]''.\n\nThe episode also covers Fry turning to religion to help locate Bender. Seeking guidance, he visits the First Amalgamated Church, which displays a collection of religious symbols above its door, including a Buddha, a cross, a Star of David, a star and crescent and eight multi-colored stars (most likely symbolizing the unity of religions). Later in the episode, Fry visits the &quot;Monastery of Teshuvah&quot; to use the radio telescope of a sect of monks who are attempting to find God in the universe. Teshuvah is the Hebrew word for repentance.&lt;ref name=&quot;gospel02&quot; /&gt; The observatory located in a monastery is also a reference to ''The Nine Billion Names of God'' by Arthur C. Clarke.&lt;ref name=&quot;cook01&quot;&gt;Cook, Lucius (April 26, 2004).

The gate of the minigolf course has a sign saying &quot;The hole with the miniture windmill is closed until further notice due to someone being inconsiderate and creating an unsanitary condition.&quot; This is a reference to the Simpsons episode &quot;[[w:c:simpsons:Natural Born Kissers|Natural Born Kissers]]&quot;.\n*In &quot;[[How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back]]&quot;, Leela says &quot;Why you little...&quot; to Professor [[Farnsworth]].\n*[[Hank Azaria]], the voice of Apu, Moe, and others, is the voice of [[Harold Zoid]].\n*[[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon's head]] and [[Matt Groening's head]] appear in the [[Head Museum]] in &quot;Space Pilot 3000&quot; and ''[[Bender's Big Score]]''.\n*In the episode &quot;[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela]]&quot;, Bender talks about some shows from the past, including one called ''The Pimpsons''.\n*In &quot;[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]&quot;, Matt Groening guest stars as himself at Comic-Con.

    "text": "[[File:Startrek.jpg|thumb|308px]]\n\n'''Star Trek''' was a 20th and 21st century phenomenon created by [[Gene Roddenberry]] in the 1960's. It was a landmark show in that it was the first science fiction television show to market itself to adults, not just children. Known for its social themes, it masked current social commentary in sci-fi storylines. In fact, television's first-ever interracial kiss took place in an episode of Star Trek (between Captain Kirk and Lt. Uhura). The original series (TOS), as it later was called, spawned a series of six TOS movies, five spin-off TV series (one of which was continued into four movies of its own, for a total of ten), and was rebooted entirely in movie form in 2009 (the eleventh movie in the franchise).&lt;ref&gt; [[http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Star Trek]] Memory Alpha, the Star Trek wiki &lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2200]]s, the cast reunited for musical specials, with the exception of Scotty who was replaced by a character named [[Welshie]].\n\n[[Philip J. Fry]] is a fan of the series and its spin-offs, but Star Trek is banned from [[Earth]] by the 31st century. The show was banned after the [[Star Trek Wars]]. By the 23rd century, Star Trek fandom had evolved to a full-blown religion. As country after country fell under its influence, world leaders felt threatened by its power. And so, Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins, by being thrown into a volcano. The original 79 episodes and 6 movies (along with the blooper reel where the door doesn't close all the way) were sent into space and dumped onto the forbidden world, [[Omega III]].\n\nIn the 28th Century, the [[head in a jar|heads]] of the original cast, except for [[Leonard Nimoy]], took off into space because the people of Earth no longer appreciated them. Sometime beforehand, the tapes of Star Trek fell into the hands of [[Melllvar]]. Melllvar also found the ship that contained the heads of the original cast members. He gave them back their bodies and made them recreate episodes of the show. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== References ==\n*Many of the music and sound effects, especially the automatic doors, from various episodes are taken from Star Trek.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n&quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot;\n*Fry's narration is a parody of the opening narration that appeared in both ''[[memoryalpha:Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' (TOS) and ''[[memoryalpha:Star Trek: The Next Generation|Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (TNG). The &quot;Space: The Final Frontier...&quot; becomes &quot;Space: It seems to go on and on forever...&quot;.\n\n&quot;[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]&quot;\n*[[Zapp Brannigan]] is introduced in this episode. He is a broad parody of Captain [[memoryalpha:James T. Kirk|James T. Kirk]].\n*[[Brannigan's Law]] is the [[Democratic Order of Planets|DOOP]] equivalent to [[memoryalpha:Starfleet|Starfleet's]] [[memoryalpha:Prime Directive|Prime Directive]].\n\n&quot;[[Fear of a Bot Planet]]&quot;\n*In [[memoryalpha:If Wishes Were Horses (episode)|DS9: &quot;If Wishes Were Horses&quot;]], [[memoryalpha:Baseball|baseball]] is revealed to be a nearly extinct sport in the Star Trek universe. One could extrapolate it could turn into something like [[blernsball]] by the 31st Century.\n*Star Trek has a history of leaders not being what they seem, such as in [[memoryalpha:The Return of the Archons (episode)|TOS: &quot;The Return of the Archons&quot;]].\n\n&quot;[[A Fishful of Dollars]]&quot;\n*The title is a reference to [[imdb:tt0058461|''A Fistful of Dollars'']] and which was in turn changed to [[memoryalpha:A Fistful of Datas (episode)|&quot;Fistful of Datas&quot;]] in TNG's sixth season.\n\n&quot;[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]&quot;\n*Moving large objects is also tackled in [[memoryalpha:Deja Q (episode)|TNG: &quot;Deja Q&quot;]].\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n&quot;[[Brannigan, Begin Again]]&quot;\n* DOOP is explicitly compared to the [[memoryalpha:United_Federation_of_Planets|United Federation of Planets]] (even though Star Trek is considered taboo). Also, the &quot;Neutral Zone&quot; in which its headquarters are located may be a reference to the [[memoryalpha:Romulan_Neutral_Zone|Neutral Zone]] between the [[memoryalpha:Romulan_Star_Empire|Romulans]] and the Federation.\n* When the Planet Express Ship comes into the new station, a riff on the theme of [[memoryalpha:Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine|Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9)]] can be heard.\n* The laser Zapp uses to cut the ribbon has settings of &quot;Stun&quot;, &quot;Kill&quot; and &quot;Hyperdeath™&quot;, a reference to [[memoryalpha:Phaser|phasers]] from the Star Trek universe.\n\n&quot;[[Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?]]&quot;\n*The entire episode, particularly the ritual arena combat between Fry and [[Zoidberg]], has close correlations with [[memoryalpha:Amok_Time_(episode)|TOS: &quot;Amok Time&quot;]].\n* When Zoidberg asks Amy to take the rubber bands off his claws (in a somewhat sexy manner), Amy's retort is &quot;Fool me 7 times, shame on you. Fool me 8 or more times, shame on me.&quot; This line is a reference to a line in [[memoryalpha:Friday's_Child_(episode)|TOS: &quot;Friday's Child&quot;]].\n*The national anthem of Decapod 10 is the same music heard during the fight scene between Kirk and [[memoryalpha:Spock|Spock]] from &quot;Amok Time&quot;.\n*Several elements in this episode, such as Decapodian mating season and the ritualistic battle to the death also mirror plot details from that particular Star Trek episode. Also the traditional [[memoryalpha:Vulcan|Vulcan]] weapon used in the [[memoryalpha:Kal-if-fee|kal-if-fee]], the [[memoryalpha:Ahn-woon|ahn-woon]], is shown as one of the weapons Fry can choose from.\n*[[Claw-Plach]] also sounds a lot like &quot;Qa'pla&quot;, the [[memoryalpha:Klingon|Klingon]] word for &quot;Success.&quot;\n\n&quot;[[The Lesser of Two Evils]]&quot;\n*Flexo's Goatee is a parody of [[memoryalpha:Mirror,_Mirror_(episode)|TOS: &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;]] where the [[memoryalpha:Spock_(mirror)|Spock]] from a parallel universe has a beard.\n\n&quot;[[A Clone of My Own]]&quot;\n*Captain Muskie's introduction music is a musical cue from the Original Series. His appearance and chair are based on that of [[memoryalpha:Christopher_Pike|Christopher Pike]] from [[memoryalpha:The_Menagerie,_Part_I_(episode)|&quot;The Menagerie&quot; parts I]] and [[memoryalpha:The_Menagerie,_Part_II_(episode)|II]].\n*It is revealed that the Planet Express ship moves in a manner similar to Trek's [[memoryalpha:Warp_drive|warp drives]].\n*The Professor shows Cubert a [[memoryalpha:Universal_translator|Universal Translator]] device, which unfortunately only translates to an &quot;incomprehensible, dead language&quot;. Cubert says hello to the translator to test it, to which the translator responds, &quot;Bonjour!&quot; This could imply that the French language no longer exists in the Futurama timeline (despite being used on several occasions). Many Trek fans have wondered why French Captain [[memoryalpha:Jean-Luc_Picard|Jean-Luc Picard]] sounds so unequivocally British.\n\n&quot;[[The Deep South]]&quot;\n*Bender's announcement that &quot;in the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a flotation device&quot; is a reference to the movie [[memoryalpha:Star_Trek:_Insurrection|Star Trek: Insurrection]], in which [[memoryalpha:Data|Data]] says &quot;in the event of a water landing, I have been designed to serve as a flotation device&quot; upon resurfacing in a lake.\n\n&quot;[[The Problem with Popplers]]&quot;\n*The title references [[memoryalpha:The_Trouble_with_Tribbles_(episode)|TOS: &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot;]], in which it is discovered that the trouble with tribbles is their astronomical reproductive rate.\n*[[Futurama Wiktionary#R|Roddenberries]] are a reference to creator [[memoryalpha:Gene_Roddenberry|Gene Roddenberry]].\n\n&quot;[[Anthology of Interest I]]&quot;\n*[[memoryalpha:Nichelle_Nichols|Nichelle Nichols]] has a cameo as herself.\n\n&quot;[[The Cryonic Woman]]&quot;\n*Gangs of savage children and adolescents are found throughout science fiction, including [[memoryalpha:Miri_(episode)|TOS: &quot;Miri&quot;]].\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n&quot;[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]&quot;\n*The Femputer is similar in appearance to Landru from [[memoryalpha:Return_of_the_Archons(episode)|TOS: &quot;Return of the Archons&quot;]].\n\n&quot;[[Parasites Lost]]&quot;\n*One could argue that the [[memoryalpha:Trill_symbiont|Trill symbionts]] are parasites that make their hosts better.\n*In [[memoryalpha:One_Little_Ship_(episode)|DS9: &quot;One Little Ship&quot;]], a [[memoryalpha:Runabout|runabout]] is reduced in size and features miniature versions of several cast members.\n*The episode title is a reference to the DS9 Season 4 Episode [http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost_%28episode%29 Paradise Lost], that title itself alluding to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost Epic Poem] by John Milton.\n\n&quot;[[A Tale of Two Santas]]&quot;\n*Leela's logical paradox mirrors that which Captain Kirk puts to the alternate Mr. Spock in TOS: &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;.\n\n&quot;[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]&quot;\n*&quot;The Civilization of Space Rome,&quot; one of the planets Hermes says was destroyed, could be a reference to [[memoryalpha:Bread_and_Circuses_(episode)|TOS: &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot;]].\n\n&quot;[[That's Lobstertainment!]]&quot;\n*The film Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation is nominated for an Oscar; this is a reference to the Star Trek fan film, Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation.

Two Trekkies are (illegally) arguing whether TOS or TNG is the better series. The TOS fan claims Kirk could kick Picard's ass.

The sign references a creature from the series called a [[memoryalpha:Horta|Horta]], which gives severe acid burns.

In an attempt to stop the [[Nudist Alien Scammers]] from traveling back into the past and thus destabilizing the space-time continuum, Nibbler ordered several Kitten class attack ships to attack the aliens. The aliens retaliated against the attack by batting at the ships with aluminum folding chairs, hitting one and causing it to crash.

Allow me to explain. Granted at first I desired only to bang out a quick cheap one with your universe, but it's your own fault. Your universe dresses provocatively.|{{PAGENAME}} in ''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''}}\n\n'''Yivo''' is a sentient, extraterrestrial being from another universe who communicated with universe &quot;gamma&quot; through the time hole called &quot;the [[anomaly]]&quot; made in The Beast with a Billion Backs. Shkle makes [[Fry]] the pope of a new religion, whose adherents are encouraged to &quot;love the tentacle&quot;. Yivo used shkler &quot;gentacles&quot; (as proclaimed by [[Leela]]) to have sex with every living being in the universe except Leela, unbeknownst to them.\n\n== History ==\nIn another universe, there existed only one sentient being, Yivo. For a trillion years, shkle was satisfied with shkler life as the lone being of that universe. But when shkle looked across immensity, shkle saw the Big Bang and said, &quot;Whoa. Who's that?&quot;. Shkle realized that the newly formed universe was shkler soul mate, including every living being in it. Some centuries ago, shkle sent an image of shklimself into the artists of the universe, portrayed as Heaven.\n\nWhen a space-time rift opens between our universe and Yivo's (at the end of Bender's Big Score when Bender causes too many time paradoxes, causing the space-time anomaly to appear), Fry is the first to cross the barrier (as robots couldn't) and meet Yivo. Yivo saves Fry from lack of oxygen and that sent shkler tentacles into the neighboring universe, sticking every living being but Leela with shkler tentacles, and declares Fry the Pope of a new religion whose main tenet is to &quot;love the tentacle&quot;. However, when Leela reveals that Yivo's tentacles are in fact &quot;gentacles&quot;, Yivo admits that shkle was planning on mating with all of them, but shkle realized that everyone is shkler soul mate and releases everyone from shkler tentacles.\n\nYivo promises to make a clean slate, going out on a date with everyone in the universe at the same time. However, though everyone had a great time, the leaders of the universe feel that shkle can't make any form of commitment to them and decide to break up, only for Yivo to propose marriage. Shkle invites everyone onto shkler back where Heaven is and makes them promise not to contact other universes. Everyone enjoys their eternity with Yivo, except Leela, who is suspicious of the monster but eventually comes to accept shklim. Suddenly, the robots led by Bender attack Yivo, pulling shklim out into their universe, where they strangely are able to harm it. Yivo discovers that their weapons are lined with the paper electromatter that Fry sent to Bender in the form of a letter. Heartbroken that Fry broke his promise, Yivo breaks up with the universe, but allows [[Colleen O'Hallahan]] to stay, as she is the only one who shkle can connect with. As shkle begins to shklufocate, Yivo returns to Shklim's home universe with Colleen.\n\n==Personality==\n\nYivo was an all knowing creature that yearned for love. When shkle discovered universe Gamma, shkle first was interested in simply having sex with the beings of that universe, which shkle later tried to justify because universe Gamma &quot;dressed provocatively&quot;. Shklee soon changed after this incident and later began a monagamous relationship with [[Colleen]] after Shklee found out that Fry broke Shkler promise.\n\n== Abilities ==\n*Yivo is entirely composed of [[electro matter]], which is impervious to all forms of assault in our universe. The only thing that can cut through electro matter is more electro matter.\n*Yivo is entirely covered in seemingly infinitely stretching, and infinitely numbered tentacles, which when stuck in someones neck, forces him/her fall in love with the monster.\n*After [[Bender]] attacked heaven (Yivo), Yivo is revealed to have a beak under schler mouth of clouds. Possibly so Yivo would resemble the mythical kraken, leading to Yivo and Bender having a standoff parodying the climax from the 2006 movie ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest''. Schle also bears a resemblance to the Sarlacc from the 1983 movie ''Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi''.\n*Yivo can also revive lifeforms at will, for example when he revived Kif.\n*Anyone on Yivo becomes immortal, for example Colleen.\n*True to it being heaven, Yivo can grant the desires of anyone that inhabits it.\n*Yivo is similiar to H. P. Lovecraft's Outer Gods such as Azathoth and Yog-Sothoth.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Yivo is based on Yahweh from the Bible but differentiates from him in a few humorous ways.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n*&quot;''[[The Late Philip J.

Blobs do not possess a one-way digestive system, instead they are able to swallow any food, or annoying [[human]], so long as it will physically fit inside them. Swallowed items will sit, visible, inside them until digested or otherwise removed from the body. Humans have the ability to remove small items, such as [[Popplers]], through the chest of a Blob, but are unable to get themselves out should a Blob swallow them. This may not be the case if the swallowed human is carrying salt, because salt de-solidifies Blobs temporarily.\n\nBlob reproduction is unknown, but may involve their spewers, which may-or-may-not be exclusive to the female anatomy. Spewers are apparently offensive to some people, despite being seen in popular art.\n\n== Planet of Origin ==\nThe potentially offensive artwork, the Venus de Venus is both the only major clue as to the true name of the Blob species and the identity of the Venusians, as the art depicting a female blob was created on [[Venus]].

    "text": "[[File:Futurama-01_0.jpg|thumb|250px|The first thing you see in an episode is a caption, like &quot;in color&quot; in the first episode.]]'''Futurama '''is an animated series creаted by [[Matt Groening]], and developed for television by Matt Groening and [[David X. Cohen]]. It is an animated television show that focuses on the lives of delivery boy [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]], [[Turanga Leela|Leela]], and [[Bender Bending Rodríguez|Bender]] in the futuristic 31st century.\n\nAt the final second of New Year's Eve [[1999]], Fry falls into a [[Cryogenic tube]] and is frozen for 1000 years, being released on [[December 31st]], 2999.\n\n== Running ==\n\n=== Original Run ===\nThe original run of Futurama began on March 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[1999]] with [[Space Pilot 3000]]. The show ran for four seasons, before FOX decided to drop the show. The final episode of the original run was released December 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2004 with [[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]. In the episode, Leela says &quot;I want to see how it ends.&quot; making this the last thing spoken in the original series.\n\n=== DVD Movie Comeback ===\nOn April 26, 2006, Groening stated that numerous people, including Cohen and many writers and actors were returning to make [[:Category:Movies|4 DVD Movies]]. These started with [[Bender's Big Score]] and ended with [[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]. They were released on TV as four part episodes. In Bender's Big Score, Hermes declared that the executives who dropped the company's contract have since been fired and ground into a fine pink powder. The DVD are classed as Season Five. The DVDs proved to be successful, so [[wikipedia:Comedy Central|Comedy Central]] declared a new series was to be made with 26 new episodes over two broadcast seasons, beginning with Season Six. On the official Futurama web site (http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/futurama/index.jhtml), it premiered on June 24, 2010.\n\n===Revival on Comedy Central===\nOnce the last DVD movie ended, season six later would have been announced to air on the [[Comedy Central]] channel. Season 6A started on June 24, 2010 and continued throughout the summer with its [[The Futurama Holiday Spectacular|Christmas special]] being its latest episode. Season 6B returned 2011. In 2012 select ABC and other local channels acquired the rights to broadcast Futurama on Monday mornings, however after the episode [[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]] it skips ahead to [[Rebirth]], Comedy Central renewed the show for a seventh season. Season 7A aired in 2012, and 7B aired in 2013. Season 7B was the last season and the final episode aired on September 4, 2013, though Matt Groening said that he will try and get it picked up by another network.\n\n==Main Characters==\n*[[Philip J. Fry]]: During his early life, he took a job as a delivery boy for Pannuci's Pizza and was frozen in a cryogenic lab for a thousand years. Upon revival, he found himself as a delivery boy once again as part of the [[Planet Express Crew]]. He is noted for his out-of-the-ordinary hairstyle. He is an often lazy guy who is driven for excitement and has a love interest for Turanga Leela.\n*[[Turanga Leela]]: Growing up at an orphanage, she left and became a Career Assignment Officer. After quitting this position due to her distaste for it, she became captain of Planet Express and became successful. She once thought she was an alien but she figured out that she is actually a mutant. She was once tricked into making love with Zapp Brannigan, but she resents and rejects him and prefers to be with other men such as Fry.\n*[[Bender Bending Roderiguez]]: A bumbling and foul-mouthed robot who was born in Mexico and found his life to have been created for nothing more than bending girders for [[suicide booths]]. The drunk, smoking gambler attempted to kill himself while meeting Fry only to be convinced to get a job at [[Planet Express]] where he continued his rebellious attitude and manifested his personality into habits like gambling.\n*[[Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth]]: A scientist who once worked at [[Mom's Friendly Robot Company]]. He founded Planet Express and took his crew(s) on deliveries that were highly dangerous. He was also an inventor mechanics and other devices, some of which were successful and others that weren't. He is however a specist and a man with multiple personality flaws that are countless. He is also a high tenured Professor at Mars University and is a member of the Academy of Science.\n*[[John A. Zoidberg|Doctor John A. Zoidberg]]: An alien doctor who does not know much about human anatomy. He was the very first employee of Planet Express and is the loneliest and most innocent of the crew. He dreams of being a comedian and has a very large appetite for food. Even though he is often bullied by his coworkers, he considers everyone in Planet Express to be his friend and can be cheerful despite his poverty.\n*[[Amy Wong]]: An enginerring student of Farnsworth's working as an intern for Planet Express. She is the daughter of a very wealthy couple living on Mars and is in love with DOOP Lieutenant Kif Kroker. She was a college student at Mars University and graduated with the highest honors. She was favorably hired as an intern by Farnsworth because she has the same blood type as him.\n*[[Hermes Conrad]]: The accountant and beareaucrat of Planet Express. He was once a former Jamaican limbo champion and former Olympic Limbo contestant. He often bullies Dr. Zoidberg and usually deducts his pay for no reason. He has a phobia of his beareaucratic rank being lowered. It is later found out that he approved Bender himself to be marked as a perfectly functioning robot despite the fact that he had been manufactured improperly; something he was never supposed to do.\n*[[Scruffy Scruffington]]: The lazy and calm natured janitor of Plantet Express. He is a man who often reads dirty magazines and is technically a zombie, though he clearly does not look like one. He does not participate very often in the Planet Express crew's missions, and many employees of the company often forget who he is.\n*[[Nibbler]]: Leela's pet Nibblonian. He is smarter than what he pretends to be and has a wise view on the universe. He is also a reliable fuel source for the Planet Express ship (i.e. dark matter, which he excretes). He is the being who was responsible for assuring that Fry was frozen on the night of December 31, 1999.\n*[[Cubert Farnsworth]]: The child clone of Hubert Farnsworth. He was created to take over Planet Express as successor after Professor Farnsworth's retirement but Cubert has dreams of his own and therefore may not inherit the company. He usually hangs out with his best friends, Dwight Conrad and Tinny Tim.\n*[[Mom]]: The evil business tycoon who is obsessed with taking over Planet Express and make a monopoly out of the business world. She is a multitrillionaire who used to have Farnsworth as an employee and lives with her three sons (one of whom is Farnsworth's child) who are a manifestation of the three stooges\n*[[Zapp Brannigan]]: The arrogant, selfish, and egotistic captain of the Nimbus ship, a DOOP battle and defense craft. He treats Kif Kroker like a slave and flirts with Leela very often. He is also a womanizer and pervert who loves to express his pride as a member of the DOOP. He also loves to be on the frontline for any war and alien invasion that is coming his way, though he will never sacrifice his own life for any said cause.\n*[[Kif Kroker]]: The extremely shy assistant to Zapp Brannigan. Even though he has been abused by Zapp, he has very incredible fighting skills and is passionatley in love with Amy Wong. He is often tired of being Zapp's slave and prefers to spend all his free time with Amy than serving Zapp's personal desires.\n*[[Lrrr]]: The ferocious alien overlord of Omicron Persei 8, who constantly seeks to win over his wife Ndnd's affection and would do anything to achieve it, even if it means invading earth. He pretends to be a tough guy to satisfy his wife but he is truthfully a sensitive man with a deep love for animals and is shown to be emotional at times.\n*[[Ndnd]]: The bossy and impatient wife of Lrrr. She wants Lrrr to invade and take over planets for her and has a rather rocky marriage with him. Ndnd believes that she can nag her husband all the time and gets extremley jealous when someone other than Ndnd nags Lrrr.\n*[[Dwight Conrad]]: The estranged son of Hermes and LaBarbara Conrad. He dreams of being a beaureaucrat like his father and once made such progress by being the newspaper delivery boy for a local newspaper company. He is also best friends with Cubert Farnsworth and Tinny Tim.\n*[[LaBarbara Conrad]]: The rowdy wife of Hermes Conrad and Dwight Conrad's mother. She often rebukes Hermes and Dwight when they do any kind of misdeed or prank. She also supports Hermes' dream of winning the Olympic gold medal for limbo and trains him to compete against his archrival Barbados Slim, although when Hermes is at low points in his life she flees him to seek the attention of Barbados much to Hermes' dismay.\n\n== See also ==\n*''[[:Category:Episodes|Episodes]]''\n*''[[Opening Credits]]''\n[[Category:Futurama| ]]\n[[Category:Real World Articles]]"

The [[Nibblonian]]s sent Lord [[Nibbler]] to knock Fry into a cryogenic tube on December 31, [[1999]], in order to preserve him so that he could defeat the [[Brainspawn]], a species able to control others through this delta brainwave.\n\nFry used his lack of the delta brainwave twice against the Brainspawn. The first time was in &quot;[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]&quot;, when the Brainspawn attacked [[Earth]] directly. [[Turanga Leela]] relayed the message to him from the Nibblonians despite the effect of the Brainspawn. The second time, in &quot;[[The Why of Fry]]&quot;, Fry himself traveled with Nibbler to his [[Eternium|home world]] and learned how he came to lack the delta brainwave, and why he was frozen in the first place. It seems the Brainspawn were learning everything there was to learn in the universe, placing it in something called an [[Infosphere]] and then destroying the universe so their knowledge would be complete. It was for this mission that Fry was sent to the future.\n\nFry once again uses his lack of the delta brainwave to save the universe in &quot;[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]].&quot; Apparently, without his missing brainwave, his mind can't be read, even by the [[Dark One]]s.\n\n== Appearances ==\n* &quot;[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]&quot;\n* &quot;[[The Why of Fry]]&quot;\n* ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''\n[[Category:Science]]"

Perhaps due to his tendency to sacrifice his people to save himself, or his greatly over-inflated ego, Zapp has had few friends during the years portrayed during the series, the closest being [[Kif Kroker]], his lieutenant, and, perhaps to a lesser extent, the [[Planet Express crew]].\n\n[[Zapp Brannigan|Read more...]]&lt;br /&gt;\n\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n[[Category:Mainpage subpages|false]]"

They were unaware that the cream granted them super powers until later that day, when they were held up by a mugger and his robot, [[Andrew]]. After foiling the intricately laid plan, they realize that they have superpowers and set out to rid the streets of [[New New York]] of crime. The crime fighting duo, later expanded to a trio with the addition of [[Bender]], quickly became treasured superheros with their own [[The New Justice Team Theme Song|theme song]]. \n\nThe New Justice Team's crime fighting career reached its climax when they received a tip that [[the Zookeeper]] was planning a heist of the [[Quantum Gemerald]] on the same day that Leela's parents were visiting the surface. The caper was late in pulling the heist, and Leela was unable to meet her parents. Convinced that their daughter didn't love them, [[Morris]] and [[Munda]] return to their home in the [[sewers]], and although Leela knew that she couldn't reveal her secret identity, she feels so guilty that she tells her parents she was Clobberella. Morris is unable to keep the secret quiet and soon after the Zookeeper kidnaps Morris and Munda to hold them ransom for the Gemerald. By this point the New Justice Team had exhausted their supply of Miracle Cream, and so was forced to pretend that they still had superpowers in order to steal the Gemerald from the Museum. After giving the Zookeeper the Gemerald, Leela's parents were released and the N.J.T. disbanded.\n\n== Members ==\n=== Captain Yesterday ===\n{{Character\n| name       = Captain Yesterday\n| image      = [[File:Cap yesterday.jpg|140px]]\n| gender     = {{Male}}\n| species    = Super powered [[human]]\n| age        = See [[Fry]]\n| planet     = [[Earth]]\n| job        = Superhero\n| relatives  = See [[Fry]]\n| status     = Retired\n| appearance = ''[[Less than Hero]]''\n| voiced by  = [[Billy West]]\n}}\n\n&lt;poem compact style=&quot;border:1px dashed #2f6fab; background-color:#eeeeee; color:#000; padding:1em&quot;&gt;\nCaptain Yesterday is fast,\nAlso he is from the past,\nNot just fast but from the past, \nCaptain Yesterday!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nSecret Identity: [[Philip J.

He is a part of [[Al Gore (character)|Al Gore]]'s [[Vice Presidential Action Rangers]] (VPAR) in an alternate reality.\n\n== Member of the Vice-Presidential Action Rangers (VPAR) ==\nWhen [[Fry]] asked the [[What If]] machine what would've happened if he didn't freeze himself and wake up in the year [[3000]], Hawking visits [[Panucci's Pizza]] and Fry asks him about the rip in space caused by Fry not falling into the [[cryogenic tube]]. Later, Hawking and the [[Vice Presidential Action Rangers|VPAR]] kidnap Fry to try and ensure that the space-time continuum is undamaged, but are unable to determine the correct course of action quickly enough to keep the universe from imploding. They become trapped in a state of non-being and are forced to play [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] for eternity.\n\n== Leader of SPACENOMALY '08 ==\nBy the 31st century, Stephen Hawking's [[Head in Jar|head]] had been preserved in a jar. Hawking led the scientific convention about the [[anomaly]] known as SPACENOMALY '08. He claimed he knew nothing about the anomaly but did make money from a book he wrote about it. When Professors [[Farnsworth]] and [[Wernstrom]] began to fight, Hawking broke up the argument by shooting freeze beams at them (an ability that Hawking himself confessed he didn't know he possessed) and suggesting that they settle it like men of science in a match of [[Deathball]]. During that time, Stephen Hawking's Head had some device around his neck to help him speak.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*Until [[The Beast with a Billion Backs]] he didn't know he could shoot lasers out of his eyes.﻿\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n*''[[Anthology of Interest I]]''\n*''[[Reincarnation]]''\n=== Films ===\n*''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Heads]]"

He told Fry of the green chi that spawned life in the universe and would bring out a new green age. He refused to say more and ordered Fry to infiltrate [[Leo Wong]]'s organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf star system.\n\nFry met the Legion once again in the abandoned [[Martian]] reserve, where No. 9 explained about the ongoing battle between the [[Encyclopod]]s and the [[Dark One]]s. The dwarf star is an Encyclopod egg, which must be hatched into order to recreate all extinct species. However, the last Dark One is heading towards it to destroy it. The full extent of Fry's mission is to save the star. Unfortunately, no one knows what the Dark One looks and he would learn of a plan even through their tinfoil hats. Luckily, since Fry lacked a [[delta brainwave]], his mind can't be read and the Legion entrust him with the Omega device meant to stop the Dark One. No. 9 and a few members of the Legion are present at the demolition ceremony, where Fry is busy trying to scan for the Dark One. Since the Dark One was impervious to mind reading, Fry concluded that he must be the Dark One. However, when he used the device on proximity to Leela, revealed the true Dark One to be a Martian muck leech. This gives time for Encyclopod to be born. The Legionnaires cheer in joy with a new Green Age in fold. However, when Hutch was about to explain everything, the Dark One killed him. The Encylopod killed it in response. Number 9 Man then asked the Encyclopod if he will preserve their enemy's DNA; the Encyclopod considered it but [[Zoidberg]] ate its carcass first.\n\n[[Matt Groening]] is a huge Beatles fan, and &quot;Number 9&quot; is central to much Beatles mythology. John Lennon himself would refer to &quot;freaks&quot; (i.e. Madfellows) who tried to read too many things into his songs (which may or may not have been really there) including the infamous &quot;Number 9 / Turn Me On Dead Man&quot; from the White Album. Thus, anyone too hung up on &quot;Number 9&quot; is in need of a tinfoil hat.\n\n== Production ==\nThe reason for his number was to indicate a yet to be revealed society caste system, where lower numbers were basically slaves, and higher numbers were of kingly status. Nines would, for example, be drones who walked around all depressed. However, this idea was abandoned before [[Futurama|the series]] went live. His actual story was changed by the writers when given a speaking role in ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''. Additionally, the re-assigned purpose of the 9 on his shirt appears to be that it is his name.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n*&quot;''[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot; (cameo during the New Years Celebration Sequence)''\n*''[[My Three Suns]]''\n*''[[A Flight to Remember]] (cameo during the Titanic Boarding Sequence)''\n*''[[When Aliens Attack]]''\n*''[[The Lesser of Two Evils]]''\n*''[[Raging Bender]]''\n*''[[How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back]]''\n*''[[Overclockwise]]''\n*''[[Reincarnation]]''\n*''[[A Farewell To Arms]]''\n*''[[Murder on the Planet Express]]''\n=== Films ===\n*''[[Bender's Big Score]]''\n*''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''\n=== Comics ===\n*''[[The Cure for the Common Clod]]''\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"

The holiday has been in existance for centuries, although the specifics of the celebration have changed throughout the years.\n\n==The History of Xmas==\n===Xmas===\nAlthough Xmas' origin is unclear, it seems to have been started by a religious sect known as the Christians, who would go on to dominate much of the world economically, politically, and religiously, as they expanded to other regions and incorporated local pagan traditions. But Christmas, as it was known in those days, came into its own with the economic system of consumerism. By the 21st century, Earthicans had developed a series of traditions for the holiday that involved everything from gathering of far flung family members, decorating yards, trees, the interior and exterior of their homes with lights, the exchange of gifts, singing &quot;chirstmas carols&quot;, and the jolly figure of Santa Claus would travel the world on the night before Chirstmas giving presents to the &quot;good&quot; little boys and girls.\n\n===Xmas and Robot Santa===\n{{quote|In all the tinsel and terror of the holiday season we too often underestimate that murderous brute better known as Santa Claus. With images of last year's gingerbread massacre freshly baked into our memories, I remind you to bolt your doors, say goodbye to your pets, and lock your children in the closet. This is Walter Cronkite saying, &quot;I told you so&quot;|Walter Cronkite's head|A Tale of Two Santas}}\n\nOver the 3rd millennium, much of the religious ceremony that had defined Christmas for much of its history appears to have discarded, though many of the other traditions survived albeit in slightly different forms. For example, while the tradition of decorating an Xmas Tree has continued from the tradition of a Christmas Tree, the traditional pine tree used in the past has been replaced by palm trees due to the former going extinct in the 2200s.\n\nBut a new tradition was begun after [[2801]], when the &quot;Friendly Robot Company&quot; (possibly a precursor to [[Mom's Friendly Robot Company]]) built a robotic Santa Claus to &quot;Yuletide&quot; specifications. While [[Robot Santa Claus]] was intended to be able to determine whether the world's population was naughty or nice and deliver presents accordingly as the mythic and non-robotic Santa of Christmas is said to have done centuries before, but a programming error resulted in standards so high that he pronounced everyone naughty and proceeded to spend Xmas after Xmas traveling around the world dishing out destruction and mayhem.\n\nFor this reason, Earth has instigated a planet wide curfew, and anyone caught outside after sundown is likely to be caught and killed by Santa Claus.\n\n==Traditions of Xmas==\n*'''The Giving of Gifts:''' the custom of giving gifts to one's friends and family for Xmas is an integral part of the celebration. These gifts may range in the form of packages wrapped up with colorful paper to cards mailed in the post.\n*'''Singing:''' Another staple in the customs of Xmas time, the holiday spirit seems to compel people to sing for some reason. A further word of warning; groups of robots have been known to use caroling as a ruse to rob homes.\n*'''Alms Giving:''' Some Earthicans use the holiday to help their fellow beings, an example of which is the liquor kitchen for homeless robots.\n*Hiding from robot santa\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n*''[[Xmas Story]]''\n*''[[A Tale of Two Santas]]''\n*''[[Bender's Big Score]]''\n*''[[The Futurama Holiday Spectacular]]''\n[[Category:Culture]]\n[[Category:Songs]]"

The futurama crew made $1 a dozen and fishy joe made $0.99 a dozen. 198 billion Popplers were sold, and [[Fishy Joe's]] made $16.335 billion.\n\n== Origin of Popplers ==\nAfter making a delivery to the Planet of the Moochers, the [[Planet Express crew]] decides to land on a remote planet to find something edible (the Moochers had taken all their food). While searching for Roddenberries, [[Turanga Leela]] discovers a pit filled with what has been alternatively described as fried shrimp or fried prawns. After determining that they were not poisonous with her [[Wrist LoJack-a-mater]], Leela, Fry and Bender discover that they were delicious and decide to take a shipload home with them. On [[Earth]], the crew decide to sell the delicious fried food under the name ''Popplers'', the only name left uncopyrighted besides &quot;Tastesicles&quot;.\n\nInitial sales were large enough that the snack was soon picked up by [[Joseph Gilman]], owner of [[Fishy Joe's]], and soon Popplers were one of the most popular foods on [[Earth]]. This success soon sparked controversy, as members of Mankind for Ethical Animal Treatment (M.E.A.T.) began protesting on the grounds of their belief that Popplers were alive. This theory was actually proved when Leela discovered an old bucket of Popplers lying around, [[Jrrrr|one]] of which called her &quot;momma&quot;. Despite proof that Popplers were not only alive, but intelligent, the food remained incredibly popular and only the invasion of the Omicronians put an end to the selling of Popplers.\n\nAfter it became known that Popplers were actually Omicronian young who are piled into pits on nursery planets until they are developed enough to join Omicronian society as a whole, the Omicronians demanded that Earthlicans stop eating their young and that they be allowed to eat one human for each Omicronian who had been eaten. As it turns out however, there were no where near enough humans to equal the billions of Popplers devoured, and so they lowered the number to the first human to eat a Poppler; Leela. Despite an ingenious scheme by [[Zapp Brannigan]] to switch Leela for an orangutan, Leela's death seemed inevitable. But Jrrr, the Poppler that spoke and alerted Leela that Popplers were sapient, intervened and Leela was spared, although [[Free Waterfall Jr.]] was not. After this incident, the selling of Popplers were banned and the remaining uneaten ones were recalled and sent back to the nursery planet.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*[[The Problem with Popplers]]\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Creatures]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Omicronians]]"

When let out of captivity however, they expand in size threefold and become highly aggressive, spouting sharp fangs. When dead and being prepped for cooking, salt should be avoided as the slug shrivels to half it's size and retains an unpalatable salty taste (however, this was only shown once, and may not be a feature of the slug itself as Bender used a pound of salt in that instance).\n\nYellow slugs are actually lime green with a purple stripe on their back.

This term may be confused with Kif's reference to Amy being his &quot;Smizmar&quot; but a Smizmar is one that creates a love attraction in an amphibian that causes them to become pregnant. A Fonfon Ru is similar to a marriage partner, but without the legal binding contract, negating the need for divorce should they decide to separate.  \n\nAccording to Kif, the individual that brings on initial feelings of deep love and affection is your &quot;Smizmar&quot; or &quot;significant other&quot;. Also according to Kif, the literal English translation for Fonfon Ru is &quot;one who does not sleep with my superior officer&quot;.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*In &quot;[[Proposition Infinity]]&quot;, Amy admits that she and Kif were not actually in a serious bond, as Fonfon Ru is not an official relationship; a weaker bond than true marriage.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== Episodes ===\n* &quot;[[Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch]]&quot;\n\n=== Films ===\n*''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''\n*''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''\n[[Category:Culture]]"

Like its predecessor, the [[Earth]]'s Supreme Court is made up of nine justices that are appointed by the sitting [[President of Earth|President]]. These justices, most of whom were [[Head in Jar|heads]] by the end of the 30th century, would hear the arguments of each side before reaching a consensus through a vote via high-speed telepathy. \n\nAt some point between [[3003]] and [[3009]], legislation was introduced that halved the votes of female justices. It is unknown when or why this occurred, though ultimately [[President of Earth|Earth President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]] would have been responsible for signing the bill into law, but it played a pivotal role in at least one court case: [[Wong]] v. [[Eco-Feministas]].\n\n== Known Courts ==\n \n[[File:FuCourt.jpg|thumb|250px|The Fu Court, during Earth v.

As noted in the commentary for [[Into the Wild Green Yonder]], the Dogg Court has several mistakes in the seating in terms of seniority, that brings some interesting things into the Futurama canon. \n\nFor example, Antonin Scalia, despite being a member of the court as a body in the 21st century, was overtaken by Paula Abdul, who must therefore have spent more time on the court before leaving it for a period including the period in which Earth v. Zoidberg was decided circa 3003, before returning to take her place as the most senior member of the court. Additionally, Ruth Bader Ginsburg had been the fifth most senior associate justice in 3003, but became the second most senior by 3009, somehow overtaking Scalia and Thomas in the process.\n\n== Known Decisions ==\n=== Alabama v. Giant Space Iguana; sometime before 3003 ===\nPlaintiff: State of Alabama&lt;br /&gt;\nDefendant: A giant space iguana&lt;br /&gt;\nDecision: Court finds that chewing the corner off the Constitution was deemed non-protected speech.&lt;br /&gt;\nSentence: Unknown\n\n=== Earth v.

Much of the structure of Earth’s Government is based on the American form of Democratic-Republicanism. Although it is possible that the world peacefully transitioned to this form of government at some point, given the past history of the planet, it seems far more likely that some sort of military conquest resulted in the unification of the [[planet]]. The planet later joined the [[Democratic Order of Planets]] after its forming at some point and subsequently became an important member of that organization and hosted its [[DOOP Headquarters|headquarters]].\n\n== United States' Influence ==\nAs noted above, Earth’s Government appears to be greatly influenced by the system of governance of the United States. This is manifested in several ways:\n*The three branch system of Government employed by the United States, (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) is nearly identical to the system used by the Earth in the 31st century (see below for more details). This is further backed by the (re)election of [[Richard Nixon]], which called into question the stipulation in the Constitution that nobody can serve more than two terms as President (although as a head he lacks a body and thus is immune to this and has been reelected to 3 terms: 3000, 3004, 3008).\n*The Earth Flag, Old Freebie, consisted of the thirteen red and white stripes of the American flag (Which was nicknamed &quot;Old Glory&quot; by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Glory WIlliam Driver]), but with the stars replaced with an image of the Earth.\n\n== Parts of Government ==\n=== Executive Branch ===\nThe Executive Branch is led by the President of Earth, although there are many other individuals involved in the part of the government. It is responsible for the running of the overall government, as well as enforcing the law.&lt;br /&gt;\n{{See also|President of Earth}}\n\n=== Legislative Branch ===\nAlthough this branch of government has yet to make an appearance in the Futurama series, it seems very likely, considering the extent the rest of the government resembles the classic legislative body (though again, the exact composition of this entity, if it exists, is unclear). This branch would be responsible for passing laws and dealing with appropriating funds for the running of the government.\n\n=== Judicial Branch ===\n[[File:FamousOriginalRay's.jpg|thumb|An example of a Lower Court]]\nThe judicial branch of Earth consists of at least two levels of courts which deal with a range of different cases:\n\n*The Lower Courts: The court system for local and regional districts (although the USA had different levels of courts, it is unknown whether 31st century Earth’s system is similarly split up). An example of such a court is [[New New York]]’s Famous Original Ray’s Superior Court, with [[Judge Ron Whitey]] presiding.\n\n*The Supreme Court, the highest court on the Planet, the Supreme Court decides high profile cases as well as determining the interpretation of laws (presumably passed by the Legislative branch). A notable development in the court occurs between 3004 and 3009, whereby the votes of female members of the court are only counted as half the value of male justices. However, this sexist law may have been considered unconstitutional after the events of Neutopia\n{{See also|The Supreme Court of Earth}}\n\n=== The Central Bureaucracy ===\nThe exact relationship between the Earth Government and the [[Central Bureaucracy]] is unclear, but there seems to be some connection between the entities as the Central Bureaucracy has influential control in Earth’s society.\n\n== Federal Holidays ==\n*[[Freedom Day]]\n*[[Xmas]]\n\n== Suffrage ==\nIt appears that any being on Earth who holds citizenship has the right to vote in elections (though being convicted of criminal activity voids this right), including [[human]]s of every variation of race, [[religion]], gender, as well as sexuality. It also includes emigrated alien species and [[robots]]. Although suffrage has been extended to all native Earthicans, voter apathy has also been continued as the public still doesn’t seem to care for politics. Also of note: while there appears to be many more robots than humans on Earth, robots only made up one third of the total votes in the 3000 election, showing that robots are even less interested in politics than organic beings.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[When Aliens Attack]]''\n*''[[A Head in the Polls]]''\n*''[[Insane in the Mainframe]]''\n*''[[A Taste of Freedom]]''\n*''[[Bender’s Big Score]]''\n*''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''\n[[Category:Government]]"

    "title": "Earth's Army",
    "text": "[[File:225px-War is the H-word.jpg|250px|thumb]]\n\nThe Earth has its own standing military that is a member of the [[Democratic Order of Planets|DOOP]] military. The Army is one of the most largest branches of the military, and is frequently used for both offensive and defensive operations. Like many of the militaries in DOOP, Earth's military seems to rely on brute force and advanced technology as its leaders suffer from incompetence.\n\n==Organization==\n\nLittle is known about the Army's organization. It is unknown if it operates independently of the Navy. In certain situations, such as the invasion of [[Spheron I]], Naval officers seemed to be in charge of the Army personnel, although this could just have been because of [[Zapp Brannigan|Zapp Brannigan's]] position of the head of Earth's military.\n\n[[File:Photo (14).png|thumb|Training aboard the Nimbus]]\n\nWhen necessary, the Army apparently trains troops in as few as one day. Training, at least under Zapp Brannigan's command, consists of physical training, weapon assembling, and jumping through flaming hoops.\n\n==Equipment==\n\nUnlike the Navy, the Army has more traditional Earth dress and class B uniforms. Dress uniforms are khaki and display the wearer's rank the shoulder. Combat uniforms consist of an OD green BDU and armored shoulders, knees, and vest as well as a helmet with a crest on top that may or may not have an orange or black visor.\n\nTroops are seen wielding different weapons in different episodes, but typically carry a laser rifle of one form or another. During the invasion of Spheron I, they were armed with Positron Shooters, which were charged by winding a handle that played a &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot; tune.\n\nThe Army also has an assortment of vehicles based on the planet's terrain. Such vehicles includes includes hovercopters, hover-jeeps, and tanks.\n\n&lt;gallery captionalign=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nphoto (9).PNG|Army dress uniform\nphoto (19).PNG|Combat uniforms and Positron Shooters\nphoto (22).PNG|Army MEDEVAC\nphoto (25).PNG|Army camp on Spheron I\nphoto (26).PNG|Hovercopters\nphoto (28).PNG|Boarding the Nimbus\nphoto (53).PNG|Hover-jeep\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n==Operations==\n\nThe Earth's Army has been involved in several operations since 3000.\n\nEarth declared war on the planet Spheron I for no apparent reason. Brannigan began the invasion by dumping his troops on the planet's surface without warning. They engaged the Spheres with mixed success. However, the war was won when a soldier, Bender, threatened to detonate a WMD unless the Spheres abandoned their planet.\n\nLater, when the Army attacked the [[Decapodian]] embassy on Earth, the Decapodians responded by sending a large fleet of warships. Due to Zapp Brannigan handing Earth's defense codes to Decapodions, Earth was unable to mount any kind of defense and was saved only by an Earth loyal Decapodian, Zoidberg.\n\nEarth also invaded [[Tarantulon 6]] and easily defeated the native [[Spiderians]]. They then took the Spiderians riches, results in a $300 tax rebate to all Earth citizens.\n\nAccording to the Chairwoman of DOOP, President Nixon invaded Da Nang 6 and keeps Earth from winning because he believes the war will be good for the economy.\n\nInvasion of Spheron I Outcome: Earth victory\n\nDefense of Earth from Decapodians Outcome: Earth defeat\n\n\n\nInvasion of Tarantulon 6 Outcome: Earth victory\n\n\n\nWar on Da Nang 4 Outcome: Perpetual Stalemate\n\nLed by [[Zapp Brannigan]] the '''Earth&amp;#39;s Army''' went to war against [[Spheron I]].\n\n==Gallery==\n&lt;gallery captionalign=&quot;left&quot;&gt;\nphoto (11).PNG|Army troops boarding the Nimbus.\nphoto (16).PNG|Army troops on the Nimbus above Spheron I.\nphoto (20).PNG|Fighting the Spheres.\nphoto (30).PNG|Army hovercopter\nphoto (32).PNG|Mobile missile launcher\nphoto (39).PNG|Attacking the Decapodian embassy\nphoto (50).PNG|Conquering the Spiderans\nphoto (55).PNG|&quot;To the winners go the spoils.&quot;\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n== Members ==\n*[[Zapp Brannigan]]\n*[[Kif Kroker]]\n*[[Fry]]\n*[[Bender]]\n*[[Leela]]/[[Lee Lemon]]\n*[[Zoidberg]]\n*[[iHawk]]\n*[[Jellyfish Nurse]]\n\n== Appearances ==\n*[[War is the H-Word]]\n*[[DOOP The Right Thing!]]\n*[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]\n*[[Anthology of Interest I]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]"

Despite Trisolian's innate xenophobia and isolation, there was at least one comedian, [[Florp]], who has taken employment elsewhere in the galaxy.\n\nDespite their relative isolation, Trisolians are considered fairly mild mannered and have rather pleasant personalities.

But now, for no reason, we challenge you to defend your honor on the basketball court.|Ethan &quot;Bubblegum&quot; Tate|Time Keeps on Slippin'}}\n\n'''Ethan''' &quot;'''Bubblegum'''&quot; '''Tate''' is the leader of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. He once declared a war of basketball on [[Earth]] for no practical reason. Professor [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] challenged him with a team of [[Atomic Supermen]]. However, since they turned out to be mere tots, he had his crew extract [[chronitons]] from the Tempus Nebula to accelerate their growth. During the game at [[Madison Cube Garden]], it seems that Farnsworth will win. Then suddenly, random time skips caught by the chroniton harvest have destabilized the nebula, accelerating the game, allowing the Globetrotters to win. Despite this victory, the Globetrotters see that the time skips could lead to the destruction of the universe. Bubblegum offered his assistance to Farnsworth, as he was an expert in physics at Globetrotter University. They soon figured to move a cluster of stars to divert the chronitons to the empty side of the universe. However, it would take a &quot;bad-ass&quot; [[gravity pump]] to move stars, including all the money on Earth, days or weeks to build it and to carefully attach it to the [[Planet Express]] ship. Luckily, convenient time skips work in their favor, allowing them to complete their task. Unfortunately, their efforts had failed, as proven by a sudden skip to [[Fry]] and [[Leela]]'s wedding. Farnsworth realized that diverting chronitons is mathematically impossible, as the time skips get worse, aging isolated spots at a time. They gathered the finest minds in the universe, which happened to be the Globetrotters. [[&quot;Sweet&quot; Clyde Dixon]] managed to figure that instead of destroying the nebula, which would take out half the universe, they rather cause an implosion, which would require a doomsday device, which Farnsworth had a collection of. The Globetrotters decide to leave, but Bender pleads to go with them. Bubblegum tells Bender that though he can talk trash and handle the ball but asks the robot if he was funky enough to be a Globetrotter; Bender meekly answers no.\n\nBubblegum later became a judge during [[Elzar]] and Bender's cooking match, along with [[Morbo]] and [[Martha Stewart's head]]. They ultimately chose the latter, as the food he cooked tasted &quot;funky&quot;, due to the LSD in it.\n\nThe Globetrotters later travel to Earth to figure out how to use paradox free time travel. Ethan figured out that it ''was'' possible, however, creating other time duplicates always ends in said time duplicates being doomed. Ethan helps retake Earth from the Scammers, commanding a Globetrotter ship with a number of other Globetrotters.\n\n== Appearances ==\n[[File:Ethan Bubblegum Tate.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;br&gt;Ethan &quot;Bubblegum&quot; Tate (left) and [[Bender]] (right)]]\n=== Episodes ===\n*''[[Time Keeps on Slippin']]''\n*''[[30% Iron Chef]]''\n*''[[Less than Hero]]''\n*''[[That Darn Katz!]]''\n*''[[The Prisoner of Benda]]''\n*''[[The Futurama Holiday Spectacular]]''\n\n=== Films ===\n*''[[Bender's Big Score]]''\n*''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''\n*''[[Into The Wild Green Yonder]]''\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Globetrotters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Scientists]]"

It originally aired in North America on [[Wikipedia:May 20|May 20]], 2001.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nWhile making a pit stop at an interstellar truck stop, [[Fry]] buys and eats an extremely old [[wikipedia:egg salad|egg salad]] sandwich from a vending machine in the restroom. On returning to [[Earth]], Fry and [[Bender]] are assigned the task of fixing the plasma fusion boiler, which promptly explodes. Bender is not damaged, but Fry is impaled by a large pipe. Despite the severity of the injury, Fry's damaged body repairs itself in seconds, and the subsequent medical examination reveals to the crew that Fry is infested with microscopic worms from the egg salad.\n\nTo eliminate the infestation, [[Professor Farnsworth]] makes miniature robotic versions of the crew, except for Fry and [[Leela]]. Because the worms know all that Fry knows and would thus defend themselves if Fry knew about the mission, Leela is assigned to distract Fry, who is not told what is happening. Controlling the micro-droids using virtual reality gear — which is apparently cheaper than actually shrinking the crew themselves — the crew board a miniature Planet Express ship, and enter Fry's ear. Throughout the travel, the crew discover that the worms are drastically improving Fry's intelligence, health and fitness.\n\nThe crew make their way into Fry's bowel, and fight their way to the [[wikipedia:Pelvic splanchnic nerves|pelvic splanchnic ganglion]], intending to cause a massive bowel movement to expel the worm society (or, as the Professor puts it, &quot;Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement; afterwards, he'll be lucky to have any bones left&quot;). Meanwhile, Leela is enchanted by the now intelligent and muscular Fry. He then reveals that he loves her but only recently was he able to articulate his thoughts. She realizes that the worms are responsible for the new, improved Fry, and sets out to stop the Professor. Her micro-droid reaches the nerve, and hacks the rest of the micro-droid crew to pieces with an axe. The Professor tells her that the worms will burrow so deep into Fry's body, he will be stuck with them forever, but Leela reasons that Fry is better off with the worms.\n\nFry is informed of what has been happening, but is more interested in romancing Leela than clearing the worms out of his body. Although the two share a romantic evening at Leela's apartment — made more powerful when Fry composes Leela a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet sonnet] on the holophonor — Leela tells Fry that she loves the new him. Worried, Fry tells her that he needs to find out something, leaves and, using his own micro-droid, enters his own body.\n\nFry confronts the worm leader and engages him in a swordfight after asking the worms to leave so he can learn if Leela loves him or just what they have made of him; he eventually blackmails the worms into leaving by threatening to kill himself by destroying the [[wikipedia:Medulla oblongata|medulla oblongata]], and they comply. With the worms gone, Fry returns to Leela's apartment, intent on finding out if Leela can love him as he truly is. Fry explains to Leela about the worms, and his decision to dispose of them. His awkward attempts at being romantic end when he mentions his previous relationship with [[Amy]], and Leela kicks him out of her apartment. Back at his apartment, Fry begins to re-learn the Holophonor, and creates a crude image of Leela.\n\n== Alienese ==\n*Two signs read &quot;Human Milk&quot; and &quot;Watch for Falling Humans&quot; in [[Alienese]].\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Death, near-death, mutilation===\nBender blows himself up at a truck stop.\n\nFry, Bender, and Scruffy survive an explosion. Only Fry is injured; he is impaled on a lead pipe, although he complains only of minor pain.\n\nLeela's avatar, in order to prevent the rest of the crew expelling the parasites, savagely dismembers every one of their avatars with an axe.\n\n===Doppelgängers===\nThe entire crew, including Fry himself, use Farnsworth's virtual-reality system to send their avatars into Fry's body.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nAt the beginning of the episode, Fry attempts vehemently to defend Leela's honor, but he expresses his feelings clumsily, referring to her as his &quot;captain&quot; rather than making any reference to his feelings for her. He then goes on to fail miserably at defending her honor, in fact providing his opponents with ammunition and even insulting Leela outright. Leela's frustration with Fry's ineptitude is clear.\n\nThis appearance of feelings for Leela is rather sudden, given that in the previous episode Fry was involved with his ex-girlfriend, and given that up until now he has expressed little interest in Leela beyond occasional feelings driven by loneliness or simple lust. Now, for the first time, Fry is expressing persistent feelings for her.\n\nLeela starts to swoon as soon as Fry shows the slightest sign of being something other than a buffoon. Her swoon disappears just as easily when Fry convinces the parasites to leave his body. In the closing scene Fry begins practicing the holophoner and shows by its projection that his feelings for Leela remain.\n\n===Sal's Speech Impediment===\nSal's speech is still almost normal at the beginning of the episode as he argues with Fry, but later on, while he apologizes to Leela, it is clear that his disorder has begun to move into a more advanced stage.\n\n===Hermes and Zoidberg===\nHermes and Zoidberg share a brief, friendly conversation.{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Three]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

She liked to talk about things of little importance at great length much to the annoyance of those talking to her. Her apartment is decorated like a fish tank.\n\nEdna went to high school with [[Doctor Zoidberg]] and laughed at him because his face was covered in barnacles. During the mating frenzy in [[3001]], she was courted by Zoidberg, however she rejected his advances claiming him to be an inferior specimen. Later, Zoidberg courted her again (while being coached on seducing Edna by [[Fry]]) this time he impressed Edna and got her to go out to dinner with him. When Edna went to the restroom she found out from [[Leela]] that Fry was behind the &quot;romantic&quot; words, she lures him to her apartment where she unsuccessfully tries to seduce him just as Zoidberg walked into the room and assumed she's &quot;cheating&quot; on him. Edna, (while smothering Fry with her breasts) confirms Zoidberg's suspicion's by saying she has fallen in love with Fry and plans to mate with him the next day. Zoidberg beyond angered, challenged Fry to [[Claw-Plach]] to settle the issue. Before the two finished their battle to the death, Edna and the [[Decapod Emperor]] left together and mated.\n\nAfter the frenzy, due to the nature of Decapodian mating, Edna should have died, but during the unveiling of the final hole of [[Leo Wong's &quot;Miniature&quot; Golf Course]], she makes an appearance in the stands and it is possible that she may have somehow survived. This is unverified, however. The fact that many older females are seen in the series, such as Zoidberg's mother, implies that only the males die from the frenzy while the females become pregnant.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?]]''\n*''[[Into The Wild Green Yonder]] (unverified)''\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Decapodians]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:One Time Characters]]"

Fry was given the first choice of weapon after correctly guessing what animal the Emperor was thinking of. It is unclear whether this is the standard method of determining who chooses first or was the method chosen by the Emperor for that particular event. Fry choose a giant nut cracker. Fry got the upper-hand on Zoidberg with the nut cracker around Zoidberg's neck. Rather than kill Zoidberg, Fry released him and gave a speech about the pointlessness of the fight. With Fry's back to him, Zoidberg took this opportunity to cut Fry's arm off, which enraged Fry back into the fight.

In response, Truman decided to actually land on the [[moon]] and founded '''NASA''' to do it. 22 years later, on July 20th 1969, ''Apollo 11'' finally landed on the moon, and Neil Armstrong and &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin became the first [[human]]s to walk on the moon.\n\nThe Lunar Module returned to Earth with the crew of Apollo 11 in 1969, and was displayed in the National Air and Space Museum in [[Washington, D.C.]] until it was returned to the original landing site on the moon by the &quot;Historical Sticklers Society.&quot; At some point in the next few hundred years humanity forgot the story and the location of the original Lunar Landing, and invented a history that has credit for the landing going to &quot;whalers.&quot;\n\nThe historic landing site was rediscovered after Fry and Leela became stranded on the moon's surface after venturing out of [[Luna Park]]. With the approaching shadow of the moon and the freezing nighttime, they took refuge in the relocated module until it was grabbed by [[Amy Wong]] using [[Planet Express Ship]]'s crane magnet.\n\nFor whatever reason, the lander is complete when Armstrong and Aldrin would have used the lander to return to the lunar command module, leaving only the landing gear, landing engine and fuel tanks on the surface.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*&quot;[[The Series Has Landed]]&quot;\n\n[[Category:Monuments]]\n[[Category:Locations]]"

But by the [[1980s (decade)|1980s]] the substance, which technically is considered a wax, had largely been replaced by other substances or technology due to public dislike of killing of whales.\n=== Resurgence of whale oil ===\nWhen Petroleum reserves dried up in [[2038]], the population of [[Earth]] again turned to whales and other alternative energy sources for fuel so they could continue their automobile oriented cultures. It is clear that [[human]]ity continued to use whale oil for internal combustion engines right through the 31st century, even as they gave up their automobiles for hovercars and spaceships, but it is unclear how important a fuel source whale oil was for these more developed modes of transportation. Certainly [[dark matter]] became the principal starship fuel for the universe after an employee of [[Mom's Friendly Robot Company]] named Professor [[Farnsworth]] accidentally transformed all the [[dark matter]] in the universe (which was linked together in the form of a single non-local meta-particle) into one of the most potent fuel sources. This event, combined with the largest reserve of dark matter being found by a [[DOOP]] scout ship on [[Vergon 6]], and more importantly the DOOP's choice to hire MomCorp to mine the reserve, led to dark matter surpassing every other source of fuel in the galaxy.\n\nHowever, in [[3009]] the dark matter meta-particle was brought close enough to the [[Anti-Backwards Crystal]] (which had also been created by Farnsworth's experiment) and dark matter was reverted to an inert state unfit as a viable starship fuel. Although Farnsworth tried to fill the need for a replacement power source with the doomed &quot;nibbler-power&quot;, the universe once again reverted to using alternative fuels such as whale oil.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Bendin' in the Wind]]''\n*''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''\n[[Category:Miscellaneous Objects]]"

    "text": "[[File:TheEssenceofPureFlavour.png|thumb|The Essence of Pure Flavor in the small crystal vial.]]\n'''The Essence of Pure Flavor''' or '''[[Helmut Spargle]]s' Magic Liquid''' was a distillation of pure flavor. He claimed it could be used to allow &quot;the inner flavor of any dish to blossom forth&quot;. It was given to Bender upon his completion of a dish deemed &quot;acceptable&quot;, despite the fact that it ultimately killed Helmut. He used it in his match against Elzar on ''&quot;Iron Cook&quot;'' which won him the title of Iron Cook and even caused [[Morbo]] the anchor monster to cry.\n\nThe liquid was kept in a small crystal vial which Bender mistook as a 'diamond vial of Mrs Dash'. Upon analysis, the liquid was discovered to be composed of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded with one oxygen molecule (water) infused with [[Wikipedia:LSD|Lysergic Acid Diethylamide]], the results of which caused [[Fry]] to go to the conclusion that it was [[Bender]]'s confidence that helped him succeed.\n\nThe secret ingredient given to Bender is referred to as 'the essence of pure flavour', which may be a reference to the flavour-enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG), a common additive in Asian cuisine. Its trade name, ''Aji-No-Moto'', means 'the essence of taste' in Japanese.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*[[The 30% Iron Chef]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Essense of Pure Flavour}}\n[[Category:Food]]"

But within a year, Humorbot 5.0 had made it big when he scored his own television talkshow aimed at a robot audience; [[Late Night with Humorbot 5.0]], where he has interviewed famous robot television stars and athletes.\n\nAlternatively it is possible that &quot;Humorbot 5.0&quot; could be a model of robot, which might explain the appearance of a television talkshow host at an amateur comedy club. But this would seem unlikely considering the tendency for individual robots from the same line to have unique names (i.e. [[Bender]] and [[Flexo]]).\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[That's Lobstertainment!]]''\n*''[[Bend Her]]''\n*''[[Raging Bender]] ([[:File:Humorbot50cameo.jpg|cameo]])''\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:League of Robots]]"

However, there are several differences that bear mentioning. The principal difference is their skulls, which have been shown or mentioned to fulfill many functions. There is a solid bone-like structure that appears when subjected to x-rays. Additionally, the forehead of the species acts as a deposit for excess fat. Finally, their large heads have the capacity to inflate and deflate to help the alien keep cool in higher temperatures.\n\n=== Other differences from humans ===\n*They do not have noses, only nostrils.\n*Their knees are more versatile and sturdy than those of humankind.\n*Based on Linda's reaction to seeing Morbo's exposed chest, we can easily assume it's very different from human chest.\n\n== As a Political/Military Entity ==\nIf we are to believe Morbo, his species is on the verge of launching an invasion of [[Earth]].

The episode is counted as the 89th of the series.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Fry]] walks in the lab where [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] is and asks him why his hair is frizzy, also why he is covered in burns. Then the Professor explains what happened after the [[Into the Wild Green Yonder|final movie]] ended. He explains that the wormhole they pass through to escaped [[Zapp Brannigan]] was actually the Panama wormhole, a sort-of &quot;Comedy Central Channel&quot; for shipping. Unfortunately, the ''[[Nimbus]]'' goes through too and began to fire on the Planet Express ship, damaging it. Fearing that they may crash, the crew activates their safety spheres. However, Farnsworth's sphere covered his whole body while everyone else's shielded only their heads, in which is because the professor was selfish. They then crashed, as well as the ''Nimbus'', right by Planet Express, with only Fry and the Professor surviving, while everyone else became skeleton from the neck down. He drops them in the machine filled with stem cells, which he had plucked from healthy adults he had murdered himself, in an attempt to revive them. As a result, everyone comes out regenerated. Zapp is not dropped in and is still hanging but he is still alive despite having most of his body become a skeleton. Bender experiences difficulty with his rebirth, with his power supply being shot. Therefore, Farnsworth attaches his new doomsday device in Bender's chest cavity. However, the device's output is too powerful for Bender's body. He has to burn off the excess energy as fast as it's produced, like continuously partying, otherwise the energy will build up and he'll &quot;explode and kill everyone here in a fireball of melted gears and splattered bowels!&quot;\n\nFry then tries asking [[Leela]] out for a date, only to notice that she hasn't emerged from the birth machine. When she does, she doesn't wake up, even to the Professor's poking stick. Sadly, Leela is in an irreversible coma. Fry, depressed about Leela's state, goes to a [[Build-a-Bot]] store and builds a [[Leela-bot|robot Leela]]. However, it doesn't act like her, so the Planet Express crew uploads her memories and appearance, taken from security camera footage. The robot Leela acts like her when she was last alive but soon finds out about her robotic nature when a hostile [[Nibbler]] takes a bite at her arm, exposing her wiring; she freaks out for an entire day. Uncertain about herself, robot Leela and Fry decide to just be friends.\n\n[[File:Rebirth.jpg|thumb|The crew's appearance after the crash.]]\n\nAfter determining that the real Leela can't be wakened (due to repeated attempts with hitting and noise), the crew travel to the planet with the [[Cyclophage]]'s preserve. Here, they attend Leela's funeral and read out her last will: her corpse is to be fed to the wild Cyclophage in the event of coma. As the beast approaches, Bender's incessant and inappropriate behavior, causes Leela to wake up to tell him to shut up. Leela is initially relieved, before she sees robot her and Fry kissing. After escaping from the Cyclophage, which latches onto their ship, they return to the base where the two Leela's confront each other and Fry. They both scold him and run away in anger. Later that night, Fry proclaims his true motive for returning Leela as a robot, while the real Leela listens on, hidden away. She forgives him, only to be interrupted by the Leela-Bot. The two Leelas fight each other, which the entire crew comes to watch. [[Amy]] passes Fry a ray gun to choose which Leela to shoot. Both Leela identify which one is which but Fry is slow on the uptake, at which they both call him an idiot. Fry then puts the gun down, refusing to shoot, only to accidentally shoot himself, revealing himself to be a robot.\n\n\n\nThe Professor explains Leela didn't die during the crash due to Fry's body shielding her. Farnsworth tossed his remains into the birth machine but nothing happened. Distraught, Leela built a [[Fry-bot]]. Unfortunately, the robot Fry [[File:Futurama_601_Rebirth.jpg|thumb|left|Electrocution of leela and robo-Fry]]experienced a malfunction due to Leela putting too much copper wadding in its stomach, resulting in it being burned and Leela being electrocuted, erasing both of their short-term memories. The Professor retrieved Leela's remains for rebirth, just as the robot Fry walked in on him.\n\nIt is then that the real Fry pops out of the machine. The robots then declared that they love each other and shed their skins and leave, speaking in ''Terminator''-like voices. The real Leela is more confused over what just happened. Fry assures her that he will wait for her eventually. Bender decides he is fed up with constant partying and begins to vibrate with the excess energy. The Cyclophage suddenly emerges, and attempts to eat Leela. Bender's severe vibrations cause one of his eyes to fall out, and the Cyclophage swallows him, believing Bender to be a cyclops. The device explodes, killing the creature. Bender emerges intact and the Professor declares that Bender expended his excess energy. The crew leave in order to celebrate, and Zapp Brannigan emerges from the birth machine saying wheeee.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Identity===\n* The entire crew except Farnsworth are killed, as well as Zapp and Kif. Their bodies are revived via Farnsworth's stem cell vat. They seem to remain the same persons that they were before, that is, they aren't obviously zombies or anything strange.\n* Leela made Robo-Fry and Robo-Fry made Robo-Leela. Both robots spend some time believing that they are the originals. Twice during this episode, Robot-Leela can be found musing on the meaning of identity and the nature of consciousness.\n* When Farnsworth finally tells the whole story and Leela learns that Fry is dead, she says, &quot;My god, I can't believe I'll never see that particular Fry again.&quot;\n* The new Fry who appears at the end of the episode isn't simply revived as the others are. Their heads stayed intact, so they are presumably the same persons as before. But Fry's brain was destroyed: the person who comes out of the stem cell vat is a clone of the dead Fry. In other words, through Farnsworth's miracle of science, this person is a copy of the original Fry in every sense that the robot was a copy of the original Fry.\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry and Leela pick up where they left off in the previous [[Into The Wild Green Yonder|episode]], only more so. When Fry proves to be unrecoverable, Leela is so grief-stricken that she creates a robot-Fry. This is a surprise, given Leela's historical cool-headedness about their relationship. Perhaps losing him has intensified her newly warming feelings for him. It is no surprise that robot-Fry creates a robot-Leela.\n\nFry appears not to changed much: he shows more than once and finally announces explicitly that he loves &quot;any&quot; Leela. Robot-Leela turns out to be slightly more cool-headed than Leela: Leela was so grief-stricken that she created a fake Fry, while robot-Leela wants to cool their relationship while she tries to sort out her confusion over her own identity.\n\nFry expresses his feelings more vehemently than ever before, saying, &quot;I love Leela, always and forever.&quot; Hearing Fry say this, Leela unambiguously expresses love for Fry for the first time.\n\nFry shows that he has in fact grown a little, when, after the robots run away together, he tells Leela, &quot;I waited a thousand years for you. I can wait a little longer.&quot; This is precisely the sort of thing Leela has always been hoping to hear: a sign of maturity with a touch of romance.\n\n===Character Arcs===\nFarnsworth pronounces &quot;whooping&quot; correctly.\n\n===Injury, Dismemberment, Death===\n* At the beginning of the episode Fry is covered with horrible burns, and nine of the eleven major characters are dead and hanging gruesomely over a vat of stem cells. As we learn later, although these crewmembers are &quot;revived&quot; in some sense, this Fry is a robot, and the real Fry is dead. That is, really dead.\n* Zoidberg cuts off Hermes' &quot;umbilical cord&quot;.\n* Bender's antenna pokes Fry in the eye.\n* Bender dies for a moment.\n* Leela spends some time in a coma and a euthanasia/memorial service is held for her.\n* Bender causes various unspecified injuries on a dance floor at a bar and is thrown out onto his back in the street.\n* Leela's comatose body takes a beating in Farnsworth and Fry's final attempts at reviving her.\n* The two Leelas have a karate fight over Fry.\n* Robot-Fry accidentally shoots himself in the chest with a ray-gun.\n* Excessive vibration causes Bender to drop one of his eyes when he decides finally to stop partying.\n* Bender explodes inside the cyclops eater, apparently killing it.\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

In the meantime [[Bender]] wants to celebrate and decides the 100th delivery and plans the party &quot;of the millennium&quot;. [[Mrs. Astor]], the person they are to deliver it to, lives in the [[Waldorf Asteroid]], however due to the soufflé's instability, it needs to be handled with care, and since Bender is gyroscopically stable, he insures the soufflé does not fall or wobble too much. The ship turns and rotates too many times, but Bender is able to keep it stable, and when they came to a rocky bridge, Bender has to run around the planet twice, to hold the soufflé stable and then jump over the bridge and he does and lands safety near the house, while the rest of the crew just walk over the bridge. The rest of the crew hides behind Bender as they expect the soufflé to explode, but is does not as Mrs. Astor only takes a bite and then throws it to the dogs where it then explodes. Mrs. Astor discover that the professor is a Farnsworth and is impressed and because [[Fry]] is his uncle she invites both Fry and [[Professor Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] to her fundraiser, where only the best families come.\n\n[[File:100th.png|thumb|left|300px|Group picture of the Planet Express' 100th delivery]]\n\nAt the fundraiser Fry has invited [[Leela]]. Mrs. Astor shows a film about the [[Land Titanic]] - the largest street-going vessel ever build - which sank in 2912 with Mrs. Astor's husband. This year the fundraiser support mutants' education below the surface. They see a film about the Mutants in the sewer and how they could use the money to the Brown University where they use their skills to build their own society. Mrs. Astor comes down to Leela and says it is all just to keep those Mutants busy so they will not come up to the ground as demand a revolution and equal rights. Fry accidentally mentions that Leela is not an alien but a mutant who illegally lives on the surface and Leela - mad at Fry - is banished into the sewers.\n\n===Act II===\nFrom the start Leela hates it down in the [[Sewers]], but her parents try to cheer her up. In an attempt to rectify his mistake, Fry, along with the rest of the crew (except Bender who is ready to party), go to the City Hall to do something. Finding out that they've harbored a mutant, Mayor Poopenmeyer sentences them to two weeks below the surface. Meanwhile, Bender organizes a giant party with a lot of people. When they have reached the sewer they meet Leela, and Fry says that he believes living beneath the surface will be a good thing as he will now understand what being a mutant feels like. Leela is angry at this and states that if he wants to understand he should jump in Lake Mutagenic and become a mutant. Fry comes up with an excuse not too and Leela is left angry at him. While walking the sewers, the crew stumble on the Land Titanic, a land bus in the shape of the Titanic which struck a mail box and sunk beneath the surface.\n\n[[File:Futurama100poster.jpg|thumb|300px|Bender celebrate the 100th delivery with a party, while the rest of the crew are down in the sewers]]\n\nAfter looking through the ship for a while, they find a safe containing a rare [[Quantum Gemerald]] and a list of passengers on board the vessel. The crew decide to stay in one of the cabins. Leela ask her parents if she was to hard on Fry and her parents try to cheer her up. Bender keeps having a party. However, when he realizes that he misses the rest of the crew, he orders everyone out and wallows in self-pity. Fry, unable to sleep, walks towards the toxic lake about to jump in. Leela, also walking around, tries to stop him but Fry jumps in anyway. She takes a boat out on the lake and pulls him out, only to find that he is now severely mutated.\n\n===Act III===\nHaving enough of the segregation, Leela, along with Fry and the rest of the crew, start a revolt against the street dwellers. While plotting attacks on [[New New York]], Fry returns to the surface for Bender, so that he can bend the Western sewage system and resend all the sewage back up the pipes. This leads to the streets of New New York being covered with sewage.\n\n[[File:The-mutants-are-revolting-20100903092552366.jpg|thumb|left|301px|Leela and Fry start a revolt against the street dwellers]]\n\nMrs. Astor demands something to be done, and the Mayor orders an Antarian to send all the waste to [[Madison Cube Garden]]. Leela leads the mutants up onto the surface and demands equal rights. Mrs. Astor orders her butler to fire a missile, which misses the mutants and hits the Madison Cube Garden, sending a tidal wave of sewage at them. Just before they are covered, Fry appears and uses the jewel to separate the sewage (in a way a lot like Moses and the Red Sea). Fry reveals to Mrs. Astor that they found the wreckage of the Land Titanic, along with a list of passengers, which included mutants. Fry reveals an old and aged mutant, revealed to be Leela's grandmother, who was a young worker on the Land Titanic when it sunk. She reveals that Mr. Astor selflessly gave his seat up for her and her mother. Touched by this revelation, Mrs. Astor asks for the mutants to be allowed to the surface, which Mayor Poopenmeyer easily allows. Leela states she now has the stomach to kiss Fry for all he's done. When they kiss, Fry returns to normal and the body of another mutant is formed. It is then revealed that Mr. Astor fell into the toxic lake and mutated many years ago. When Fry jumped into the lake, Mr. Astor lodged himself into his mouth. Mr. and Mrs. Astor are united once again and hug. The crew returns to the Planet Express headquarters with Leela's family and celebrate their 100th delivery by dancing.\n\n== Production ==\n\nAccording to [[David X. Cohen]], the 100th episode may had serve as a season finale, depending on [[Comedy Central]]. A photo of [[Mike Rowe]]'s production script has been uploaded by Mike Rowe onto his Facebook page. The cover of the script highlights it as the 100th episode, as well as revealing the title, &quot;The Mutants Are Revolting&quot;, indicating the episode contain [[mutant]]s other than Leela, including [[Fry]] after exposing himself to the irradiated lake in the sewers, becoming a horrendous mutant (as shown in the Comedy Central preview trailer).\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

It aired right after [[Rebirth]] on June 24, 2010.\n\n{{Quote|This is it! The moment we should have trained for!|Leela}}\n\n== Plot ==\n[[President Nixon]] and [[Zapp Brannigan]] enlist the [[Professor]]'s help to destroy a Death Sphere, named [[V-GINY]], headed towards Earth. Zapp and [[Leela]] pilot the Professor's invisible stealth fighter inside the V-GINY, but they are attacked and forced to crash down on an uninhabited paradise planet. Leela finds herself trapped under a fallen tree, forcing her to depend on Zapp for her survival. Soon Zapp and Leela begin surviving naked, using leaves to cover their privates, and the pair start to work through their past differences, particularly when the Earth's destruction at the hands of the Death Sphere forces Leela to ponder whether this planet is their own Garden of Eden, and whether she and Zapp are now humanity's Adam and Eve. Meanwhile, the crew find out the V-GINY only &quot;censors indecent planets&quot;, which prompts them to convince the V-GINY that there's still purity in their world. The crew goes to the last unspoiled island on Earth after failing to convince the people of the world to repent. Shortly afterwards Leela discovers Zapp has been misleading her, and the crew stumble upon Leela and Zapp, explaining they're still on Earth. This enrages Leela even further and just as she's kicking Zapp's ass, they are approached by the V-GINY. The sphere proclaims that it's convinced there's still hope that this world might be redeemed, after watching Adam and Eve's antics, referring to Leela and Zapp. However, it orders them to consummate their union immediately. Failing to obey will lead to the planet's destruction. Leela weighs out her options and regards this as &quot;taking one for the team&quot;. The V-GINY flying away pleased from Earth, and Fry screaming in agony due to his request for censoring the consummation being denied by the V-GINY. The episode ends with Zapp &amp; Leela having sex.\n\n==Ongoing Themes==\n\n===Fry and Leela===\nFry objects to the idea of Leela going on the mission to sabotage V-GINY, even before he knows that Zapp will accompany her. After he adjusts to the idea, he gives her a care package to take with her. It seems that his maturity level is still improving, something Leela surely appreciates, and she shows it with some tender words and even a kiss. This is a stability in their relationship that we haven't seen before.\n\nStill, Fry is Fry: not ten seconds after he worries out loud about Leela's delayed return, he eagerly accepts Amy's offer of end-of-the-world sex. Sadly, when Zapp treats her better than dirt for more than ten seconds, Leela forgets all about Fry and is suddenly ready to bear Zapp's children. When she finally puts on the brakes with Zapp, it's not because of Fry at all, but because she starts to suspect Zapp of scamming her.\n\nFry discovers Leela and Zapp naked. He is happy to see Leela beating Zapp, but he shows no sign of jealousy, even when they have sex right in front of him. It's difficult to tell where Fry and Leela will go from here.\n\n===Character Arcs===\nSal's speech impediment is noticeable, but he is mostly intelligible.\n\n===Death, Injury===\n* Zapp shoots Emperor Chop-Chop in the chest.\n* V-Giny destroys three inhabited planets.\n* Zapp smacks his nose, and later his groin, against Farnsworth's stealth fighter.\n* Bender laments the death of his guinea pig.\n* While Farnsworth describes the formation of V-GINY, his presentation holgram explodes, throwing the bodies of everyone pleasant in every direction.\n* Farnsworth slaps Fry in the face.\n* For a while, Leela believes that the earth has been destroyed.\n* An apple falls from a tree and hits Leela on the head.\n* Leela beats Zapp when she finally gets the whole truth of his ruse to get sex from her.\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

    "text": "{{Tab|Ref}}\n==Trivia==\n* It turns out Bender is the one who destroyed the city while Fry is frozen in the year 2308, as seen in Futurama: Bender's Big Score.\n* Opening theme promotion: IN COLOR\n::Opening theme cartoon: Little Buck Cheeser (1937) (MGM)\n*When Fry asks the head of Leonard Nimoy, aka Mr. Spock, to do the Live Long and Prosper finger thing, Leonard says he no longer does that. It is presumed in this episode it is simply because he has no hands, but the truth behind this statement is seen in the future episode, &quot;Where No Fan Has Gone Before&quot;.\n*Fry is frozen holding a LöBrau beer from 1999. But in later episodes he is seen drinking the same brand. So somehow that company lasted 1000 years...\n*A Professor Farnsworth invention seen in this episode is [[Relative Box|The Relative Box]] .\n*The Panucci's Pizza box Fry is delivering reads 'Do not tip the delivery boy!'\n*The Circle Line ship can be seen shipwrecked under New New York Harbor.\n*In the intro, the Statue of Liberty holds a gun in her torch hand, but during the episode, in the future, she is holding part of the 'travel-tube.'\n*In 1999, Fry rides his bicycle past 'O'Harrison's Pub.' In the future, Fry goes past 'O'Zorgnax's Pub,' which looks quite similar.\n*Bender and Fry hide out in the Head Museum a lot longer than it seems, because it's dark outside once they escape.\n*The Applied Cryogenics lab is on the 64th floor.\n*A sign on the wall reads &quot;Drink Slurm.&quot; The same sign appears off to the left, but the word DRINK is written in Alien Language #1. This was to help viewers learn the code and try to decipher it.\n*The newspaper caption seen in the pay-box just before Fry enters the Cryogenics lab reads '2000! DOOMSAYERS CAUTIOUSLY UPBEAT.'\n*When Fry is delivering the pizza, he passes by a sign written in Chinese. When translated, the characters say &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;women.&quot; This probably being loosely translated to mean 'hot women.'\n*Bender takes Fry to hide inside the 'Head Museum' saying, &quot;It's Free on Tuesdays.&quot; 31 December 2999 will, in fact, be a Tuesday.\n*As the group is escaping the restaurant, there is graffiti written in Alien code on the wall in the alley, saying 'VENUSIANS GO HOME.'\n*The suicide booth says &quot;You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-N-Drop, America's favorite suicide booth since 2008&quot; even though the person using it is dead.\n*In the opening credits you can see the cast of the show flying though the tubes.\n*In the opening sequence, you see a taxi cab pass by with an advertisement on its roof that says 'Liquid Wisdom.'\n*In the alien ship, as they are counting down to the new year you see two symbols on the screen. This is not an Alien Code, its just a fancy way of writing &quot;6&quot; and &quot;7.&quot;\n*In the head museum, several famous heads that are seen include; Johnny Carson, Lucille Ball, Ed Begley Jr., David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Liz Talyor, Dennis Rodman, Billy Corgan, Barbra Streisand (incorrectly spelled &quot;Barbara&quot;) and Matt Groening.\n*In the Hall of the U.S. Presidents; Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, Warren Harding, Andrew Jackson, Grover Cleveland, and Benjamin Harrison.\n*There are actually two heads of Grover Cleveland. This is a reference to the fact that Cleveland is the only person to serve two non-consecutive terms as President, and is numbered as both the 22nd and 24th President of the U.S.\n*Leela's officer code is 1B-DI (One Beady Eye).\n*The signs and billboards seen during the opening credits read: &quot;Public Library&quot;, &quot;Rent a Human&quot; (in Alien Code), &quot;Drink Slurm!&quot;, &quot;Eat Bachelor Chow: Now with Flavor!&quot;, &quot;Mom's Robot Oil: Made with 10% More Love than the Next Leading Brand&quot;, &quot;Liquid Wisdom&quot;, &quot;BAB - BIG APPLE BANK&quot;, &quot;Girls, Girls, Aliens&quot;, &quot;All Tenticle Massage&quot;, &quot;Mass Hypnosis Hour - TV's #1 Show!&quot;, &quot;Flesh-O-Poid Dating Service&quot;, &quot;Sexatorium&quot;, &quot;3D Rulez!&quot; (in Alien Code), &quot;Park - $42&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Chow: Makes its Own Gravy!&quot;, &quot;Tasty Human Burgers&quot; (in Alien Code), &quot;DEF-CON - Kills Owls Dead&quot;, &quot;Robot Wash&quot;, &quot;MOM'S Friendly Robot Company&quot;, &quot;Smar! Sausages&quot;, &quot;Got Protoplasm?&quot;\n*French has become a dead language in the thousand years Fry has been frozen. This is evident during the New Year's 3000 countdown where the people of France say &quot;Seven.&quot;\n*You can see Nibbler's shadow on the floor as Fry falls backwards into the tube. A story line that was set up in advance when the show was being created.\n*When Fry is seen taking his first stroll in the new millennium, a nudist couple passes by censored with black bars. They probably used a black bar generator shown in the episode &quot;A Leela of Her Own&quot;, when she joined the New New York Mets.\n*By simple calculations, Fry should have woken up a few seconds after midnight on Wednesday, January 1, 3000. BUT the earth does not rotate by our simple math. By rough estimation, the Gregorian (standard) calendar millennium is about 7 1/2 hours short of 1000 rotations of the earth around the sun despite only having a century leap year every 400 years. Therefore, Fry waking up during daylight hours and having plenty of time to do all the things he did can be explained by the fact that he was unfrozen at the end of 1000 Gregorian years, but the earth hadn't quite made it there. He was unfrozen at about 4:27 PM on December 31, 2999.\n*In the 2999 countdown, Bender pulls the arms off the chair he was sitting on. A moment later, an armchair is missing.\n*Technically, Bender did not bend the bars as he was persuaded to by Fry when they were at a room at the head museum escaping from Leela. He just pulled them off and he bended the bars next to them to trap Leela although it is presumed that she bent them back to shape as she still chased them.\n*Amy, Zoidberg, and Hermes were the only main characters in the series that did not appear in the pilot.\n*When aired today on Comedy Central, some of the scenes from the episode have been removed when aired, such as skipping over several lines between characters.\n\n==Notes==\n*It took the cartoonists over 2 years to come up with the look of the characters on the show.\n*The 30th Century Fox logo at the end of this and every episode almost didn't happen as FOX didn't approve of the idea. Matt Groening then commissioned it at his own expense, and seeing the results, FOX gave the go-ahead and reimbursed Groening.\n*There are many characters introduced in this episode including Philip J. Fry, Leela, Bender, Professor Hubert Farnsworth, President Richard Nixon, Leonard Nimoy, Smitty, URL, and the Cryogenics staff.\n*In the first and second network airings on FOX, the man who entered the pneumatic tube, just before Fry, asked the tube to take him to &quot;J.F.K. Junior Airport.&quot; After the plane crash death of J.F.K. Jr., the line was changed to &quot;Radio City Mutant Hall&quot; for the subsequent airings, and on the DVD. Although the animatic (found on the DVD) still has the JFK Jr. line.\n** Although the JFK Jr. reference has been dubbed out (even on the DVD), in the Spanish dubbed version of this episode, the man can still be heard asking to be taken to JFK Jr. Airport.\n*The Original Alien Language devised by the writers and hidden throughout the episode was solved completely by fans after only the first and one airing. The Second language took several months.\n*In the rough draft version of the script, Michelle was named Janet, and Fry was actually named Curtis Fry. It was changed to Philip after Phil Hartman, who was set to have a recurring role as Zapp Brannigan on the series until his unfortunate murder.\n*This was voted the best episode of Futurama during the Adult Swim marathon.\n*When Matt Groening and David X. Cohen were starting this show, they decided to add little secrets to some episodes that would pay off in later episodes.\n*This episode is the most watched premiere episode in FOX's history.\n*According to the DVD's audio commentary, John DiMaggio (Bender) had originally auditioned for the voice of the Professor, and co-creator David X. Cohen had actually considered doing the voice of Bender.\n*Although Fry entered the freezer at midnight on January 1, 2000, he wakes up early on December 31, 2999. There are many different explanations for this, the simplest being that the freezer clock is not accurate enough to accommodate a thousand years. A more complex (and more likely) argument involves the difference between a Gregorian year (which averages 365.2425 days per year) and a tropical year (which averages approximately 365.2422), leading to a discrepancy of 0.3 days or 7.2 hours... placing Fry's &quot;awakening&quot; at 4:36pm, December 31, 2999. Another possibility is that the freezer was programmed for 1000 Gregorian years, or 365242.5 days, which means he would be awakened at 12 noon on December 31, 2999, which is consistent with the daylight shown outside the window when Fry awakens.\n\n==Allusions==\n===Matt Groening===\nIn the head museum if you look fast enough, a head of a man with brown hair and glasses can be seen, with the name Matt Groening written underneath. Matt is the creator of Futurama, as well as the popular cartoon sitcom The Simpsons.\n===The Watergate Scandal===\nWhen the head of Richard Nixon says &quot;You just made my list!&quot;, this is a reference to the Watergate Scandal. Nixon kept an 'enemies list' of over 200 people whom he believed were part of a conspiracy against him.\n===Donald Duck===\nThe 'Suicide Booth' is based on a Donald Duck cartoon where he went into the future and played numerous coin-op devices which injured him severely.\n\n===Sleeper===\nThe premise for the series is similar to the movie Sleeper, and the concept of the 'Suicide Booth' is similar to 'Sleeper's Orgasmatron.'\n===Life in Hell===\nA sign outside that reads &quot;Akbar.&quot; Akbar was the name of a gay character in Matt Groening's comic-book series Life in Hell.\n\n===The Caves of Steel===\nThe way in which Bender swallows his empty liquor bottle is a reference to a robot in the Isaac Asimov novel The Caves of Steel.\n\n===War Games===\nThe first scene where Fry is teaching a kid how to play a video game also occurs in the movie War Games. In the film, the first scene with the character David Lightman has him playing Galaga. He then leaves and gives the control of the game to a kid.\n===Young Frankenstein===\nThe scene with all the heads in jars and the two live ones in the middle, and then the camera shot doing a double take is a direct reference to the film Young Frankenstein.\n===Volkswagen Beetle===\nOne of the cars on the street before Fry and Bender enter the Head Museum looks like a Volkswagen Beetle. It swerves past a Slurm truck that was going too slow.\n===Star Wars===\nThe part where Fry gets hit in the head by the remote door is a possible reference to the scene in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, where one of the stormtroopers accidentally bumps his head into a similar gadget.\nThe lightsabers in which the police use look the same as those in the Star Wars series.\nA guy on a jet bike is wearing a helmet like Leia wore in Return of the Jedi on the speeder bike.\n===The Simpsons===\nFry's middle initial is J. This seems to be a popular choice for Matt Groening characters, having used it for Homer, Bart and Abe on The Simpsons. Matt uses the &quot;J.&quot; middle name, referring to one of his favourite shows, The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.\nFry also passes a three-eyed fish when going under water in the tube, this fish being 'Blinky' from The Simpsons episode 'Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish.'\nThe chef on the Panucci's Pizza box is very similar to the chef Luigi in The Simpsons episode 'Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song.'\nWhilst in the Head Museum, Matt Groening's head is able to be seen, as well as Rodney Dangerfield's, who is drawn as his Simpsons character Larry Burns from the episode 'Burns, Baby Burns.'\nFry has 9 spikes in his hair just like Bart Simpson from Groening's hit show The Simpsons.\nWhen Fry uses the 'travel-tube,' a person who resembles Ralph Wiggum can be seen. The man who is giving the pizza to Fry looks like Superintendent Chalmers.\n===Got Milk?===\nWhen Fry walks out of the lab, an ad on a taxi behind him reads 'Got Protoplasm?', this being a reference to the Got Milk? series advertising slogans.\n===H.G Wells' The Time Machine===\nWhen Fry is frozen in the cryonic chamber, time is seen passing outside the window until the year 3000. New York City is leveled by aliens, rebuilt as a medieval city, leveled again by aliens and rebuilt as New New York. This is a parody of the scenes in the film The Time Machine based on H.G Wells' novel when the inventor pushes the lever forward on his Time Machine and sees the world, and time, moving forward very rapidly.\n===Monkey Fracas Jr.===\nFry is playing a video game called 'Monkey Fracas Jr.' at the pizza place, during the start of the episode. The game starts out as a space shooter similar to Asteroids or Defender. At the end of the level, the ship approaches a saturn like planet, at which point, the planet breaks in half, and an ape resembling Donkey Kong emerges. The ape throws barrels at the spaceship and destroys it. The game's name itself, and the ape throwing barrels are parodies of the game Donkey Kong, Jr.\n\n===Pulp Fiction===\nThe Robot Policeman, URL, says he would go &quot;24th century on their ass.&quot; This being a reference to the 1994 film Pulp Fiction where the character Marsellus Wallace says to Zed and the Gimp &quot;I'm a get medieval on yo' ass.&quot; This makes even more sense as we see a medieval civilization arise after the first destruction of New York (before it was destroyed again and New New York was built).\n\n===Fry's Appearance===\nFry's primary costume of blue jeans and a red sports jacket resembles James Dean in the movie Rebel Without A Cause.\n===The Beach Pneumatic Subway===\nThe pneumatic tubes that transport people all over New New York are an allusion to The Beach Pneumatic Subway, which was a failed attempt in 1870 by Alfred Ely Beach to move people around New York by air power.\n===Hot Dog On A Stick===\nThe feeding lady at the head museum is wearing a uniform like that at the corn-dog specific restaurant, Hot Dog on a Stick.\n===War of the Worlds===\nThe ships that level the city in the background during the time skip sequence are the same as the ones seen in the 1952 film War of the Worlds.\n===Star Trek===\nTheme played with the video game during the first scene.\nFry comments on the door being &quot;just like on Star Trek.&quot;\nLeonard 'Spock' Nimoy that he no longer does the Vulcan 'live long and prosper' sign.\nThe whole Head Museum concept is, possibly, a subtle reference to the original Star Trek series episode 'Return To Tomorrow' where the alien minds were preserved in glowing spheres.\nSeveral sound effects used within the episode also. All of these are direct references to the Star Trek series\n===Mystery Science Theater 3000===\nThe number '3000' can be seen written on the moon, and it looks like the Mystery Science Theater 3000 logo, it's in the same typeface.\n===Logan's Run===\nImplanting a 'fate chip' in the palm of the right hand is a reference to the movie Logan's Run, which also spawned a TV series.\n===The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy===\nAside from having the same type of premise as Douglas Adams' novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Bender acts much like the cynical manic depressive, Marvin the robot, and the coffee machine in Professor Farnsworth's ship is a reference to &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; in which a spaceship's specialty was producing hot drinks.\n===Doctor Who===\nThe countdown to the millennium occurring at the same time all over the world is the same as the countdown in the 1996 tv movie Doctor Who.\n===Beneath the Planet of the Apes===\nWhen Fry goes back to Old New York, it is a quick reference to the people going underneath the world in Beneath the Planet of the Apes.\n===Logan's Run===\nThe chips that people have implanted into their hands is a reference to the the 1967 book and 1976 movie by the same title &quot;Logan's Run.&quot;\n\n===Phil Hartman===\nFry's first name, Philip, is a tribute to the late Phil Hartman. Hartman was originally cast to do the voice of Zapp Brannigan, but was tragically murdered by his wife before production started.\n===Philo T. Farnsworth===\nProfessor Farnsworth is named after the inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, a Utah native and television pioneer whose invention was premiered at the 1939 New York World's Fair, along with the Futurama exhibit.\n===Futurama===\nThe title of the show, Futurama, was the name of the famous General Motors exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair that depicted a futuristic landscape.\n===Olde Fortran Malt Liquor===\nIn the pub, Bender can be seen drinking 'Olde Fortran Malt Liquor.' FORTRAN was the name of the first high-level computer language.\n===Atlas Shrugged===\nA directive put in place in this Ayn Rand novel is similar to the &quot;Permanent Career Assignment&quot;, where to quit results in those who do it being refered to as &quot;deserters&quot; as part of the directive prevents anyone from changing their job or even quitting it.\n===Donkey Kong===\nAt the beginning of the episode, in the video game a gorillia throws barrels, like Donkey Kong.\n[[Category:References]]"

    "text": "{{Tab|Gfs}}\n==Goofs==\n* The existence of Radio City Mutant Hall is inconsistent with the series describing mutants as needing a pass to even venture above ground. However, for example, the Washington Redskins is not a team composed of Native Americans, nor are the Vikings all Danes or Swedes; the building could well be called &quot;Radio City Mutant Hall&quot; to obtain a reflected glory in much the same way.\n*When in the bar, Bender says he doesn't need to drink. In later episodes it is said to fuel their power cells, although it could be argued he could just drink pure oil.\n*Bender bends the bars in the Criminal Room of the Head Museum. In the next scene with Bender in the foreground, the bars are back to the original position.\n*The Aplied Cryogenics building was in New York but above ground in New New York its possible that the tubes where moved to a new building in New New York\n*When in the head museum, after Nixon's head falls, there are two Grover Clevelands on the bottom shelf — because Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms as President of the United States.\n*In the scene in Old New York, where Leela quits her job and Bender steals her ring, she clearly puts the ring back on her finger. However, when her hand reappears after being hidden behind her leg, the ring is gone.\n*Leela wasn't wearing a ring prior to the handholding scene with Fry.\n*In the beginning of the episode, The Cryogenics building stays on the Old New York surface. But afterwards, the building's on the surface of New New York.\n*The career chips of the previous Planet Express crew come from an envelope stating they were found in the stomach of a space wasp. However, it is learned in the future episode, &quot;[[The Sting]] &quot;, that they were killed by space bees.\n*No one reacts oddly or in alarm to Fry saying that Leonard Nimoy was Spock in public like they did in the future episode, &quot;Where No Fan Has Gone Before&quot;.\n*While Fry is frozen, aliens come and destroy civilization twice, but there are no ruins for the medieval civilization that rose up after the first time.\n*During the complete earth shot in the countdown scene, the western hemisphere was shown in complete daylight, which does not correspond with Fry being in New York City at midnight.\n*The career chips system introduced here, in this episode, are contradicted several times throughout the series through job changes, incompetents, examples of a free market economy and references to the &quot;Earthican dream&quot;.\n*Professor Farnsworth's slippers change color and shape from one scene to the next when in the Planet Express building.\n*The man in Leela's poster, who gives a thumbs-up, has five fingers on each hand. People within the Futurama universe, maybe apart from select mutants, have four.\n*When Bender snapped the bars in the hall of criminals, there were 2 bars left on each side of the window, but a quick close-up showed 3 bars left on each side, and then the scene resumed with the 2 bars.\n*When Fry and Bender are at the bar, the barman hands Bender a bottle of liquor. He takes a big swig of it, but the level in the bottle remains the same.\n*When Fry falls into the cryogenic chamber his party horn drops right next to the chair. When it cuts, it's gone.\n*When Fry is in line for the booth, he opens the piece of paper showing the picture and writing. Just before he steps into the booth, it changed color and went blank, then in the next shot it's back as before.\n*In the countdown scene, it shows various countries counting down from 10, but all the countries would be in different time zones.\n*The last set of buildings built before Fry wakes up looks totally different than it does when Fry wakes up and looks out the window.\n*At the Cryogenic facility, right where Fry shouts &quot;Pizza delivery for...&quot; the desk is positioned almost parallel to the window, but when Fry sits down at the desk, its positioned perpendicular to the window. And Fry can't have moved the desk because in both shots the freezing chamber is placed behind it so he would have had to move that as well.\n*When Leela is calling for backup outside the head museum, her arm band switches from her right arm to her left.\n*When Fry and Bender are in the museum and locked in the &quot;Villains&quot; room, Bender pulls out the two bars in the window, and then his arms falls off. As he puts his arms back in, you can see behind him that the bars are back in place in the window.\n*David Duchovny is seen in the Head Museum, but Calculon claims to be him in &quot;The Honking.&quot;\n[[Category:Goofs]]"

Fry]], buying an [[eyePhone]]}}\n\n'''Attack of the Killer App''' is the third episode of [[Season Six|Season 6]] (broadcast season 7).\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n[[Momcorp]] has come out with the [[eyePhone]], and the crew get new phones that are inserted into their heads, recording everything they see. An unflattering video of [[Leela]] makes the rounds online, thanks to Fry. [[Mom]] also created [[Twitcher]] so she can use information against consumers, and a virus to make followers zombies so they will buy the [[eyePhone 2.0]].\n\n== Plot ==\n\n[[C. Randall Poopenmeyer|Mayor Poopenmeyer]] opens the 83rd or 84th annual ''E-waste recycling festival'' by throwing out the ceremonial first dump. [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] discards dangerously unstable [[Doomsday Device]]s, stating he'd rest easier not knowing where they were. [[Fry]], [[Leela]], [[Amy]], and [[Zoidberg]] throw out a Japanese toilet because it knows too much. Bender, trying to get rid of some &quot;evidence&quot;, finds [[Flexo]] in one of the dumpsters – apparently the bender units are outdated, radioactive, and cause erectile dysfunction. When [[Scoop Chang|a reporter]] asks Mayor Poopenmeyer whether E-waste was dangerous, he replies &quot;Not at all, Scoop. Not after it's hurled off to the [[Third World of the Antares System|Third World]] by an expendable team of minimum-wage nobodies&quot; – the [[Planet Express crew]] of course.\n\nUpon arriving on the Third World of the Antares System, a blue alien informs the crew that their &quot;old clunker&quot; will be dismantled shortly. When Leela clarifies that they have come to deliver E-waste, not the ship, the [[Planet Express ship]] and Bender are already stripped of their exterior. The waste is unloaded with a hover-dumpster and “processed” with gas and a match. The blue alien explains the process of burning the E-waste down to the usable metals, &quot;safely&quot; releasing the toxins into the air and the drinking water.\n\nBack at the [[Planet Express building]], Leela summarizes that she later learned some positive aspects of recycling, too, but an even better behavior is to not produce as much E-waste in the first place. She retrieves her outdated cellphone from a trashcan, only to throw it away again after watching a commercial for the new [[eyePhone]]. The entire crew agrees to buy eyePhones online and ditch their old phones. Outside, Fry learns that by &quot;online&quot; Leela actually meant standing in line for the store, which is on the other side of the city.\n\nAfter the crew purchases their eyePhones they all start using them excessively, and it is revealed that [[Mom]] designed the eyePhone and Twitcher to collect personal information for marketing purposes, updating old fashioned methods of gathering information such as Spybots and the [[Infosquito]]. Fry becomes jealous of Bender who has many more followers on Twitcher. They agree to put a wager on who would have a million followers first. Fry says that he will not stoop to the sleazy level of Bender's posts. After falling far behind and fearing the fact that he will have to dive into a pool of goat vomit, Fry decides to leak a video of Leela lancing a singing boil on her butt, called [[Susan]]. This post allows Fry to receive many followers and Bender and Fry both reach 1 million followers at the same time.\n\nSoon after the video is released, Leela becomes depressed, due to everyone looking at her embarrassing butt boil, including when she leaves a restaurant, where the wind opens an opening to her behind, and she is then swarmed with papparizzi.\n\n[[Mom]] uses Twitcher to release a computer virus – affecting the human brain – upon the between one and two million followers, turning them into mindless zombies craving the new eyePhone 2.0.\n\nFry feels horrible about leaking the video of Leela, and decides to dive into the pool of goat vomit even though he didn't have to. Leela tells Fry that she is glad he released the video because now she doesn't have to hide Susan.\n\n== Continuity ==\n\n* Amy's phone from &quot;[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]&quot; is seen again when the crew members throw away their old phones.\n\n== Pop culture references ==\n* Leela wore a white knee length dress when she walked out of Elzar's and said dress got caught by the wind from an undraft in the subway station below, causing said dress to fly up, spoofing Marilyn Monroe in ''The Seven Year Itch''.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Mom Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

Farnsworth: &quot;Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions.&quot; Destroying approaching asteroids, regardless of their proximity to Earth, has the tendency to reduce them to a cloud of smaller asteroids still heading toward Earth. The means of dealing with collisions currently envisioned involves diverting the path of an asteroid with conventional propulsion systems or their higher powered counterparts, nuclear electric propulsion systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcolony.com/art.php?id=0303050 Nuclear Propulsion]&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in perfecting the NEO diversion technology, successfully landing on an asteroid, has already been achieved, &lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040624182913/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/madmen_techwed_040519.html The asteroid lander NEAR on Eros]&lt;/ref&gt; but key to any type of asteroid collision prevention is long range detection, unceasing vigilance, and prompt action (read: funding).\n*The films ''Armageddon'' and ''Deep Impact'', were both released in 1998 and both dealt with asteroid collisions. ''Armageddon'' dealt more with the drama of the space mission, and many of its reputed 168 scientific inaccuracies are from those scenes; ''Deep Impact'' depicted more of the effect of the crisis on Earth.\n*Numerous references to 20th and 21st century consumer items found on the surface of the garbage ball, including a [[Bart Simpson doll]], a [[Wikipedia:Spock|Mr. Spock]] collector plate and a deposit of [[Wikipedia:America_Online|AOL]] floppy disks.\n*In [[2620]], &quot;to end all those stupid jokes once and for all&quot;, Uranus was renamed to [[Urectum]].\n* After eating [[Bart Simpson doll]]'s shorts.

The title of the episode is a riff on the famous line &quot;Hell is other people&quot; from Jean Paul Sartre's one act play ''No Exit'' though the episode has little to do with the actual play. The punishments in Robot Hell are similar to the levels and rationale which are portrayed in Dante's ''The Divine Comedy'', specifically the Inferno. The &quot;Fairness in Hell act&quot;, wherein one must engage in a fiddle battle to save their soul is taken directly from The Charlie Daniels Band song &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;. The jokes poking fun at New Jersey in the episode are due to the fact that writer David X. Cohen and actor John DiMaggio both grew up in the Garden State.\n*The Temple of Robotology is a spoof of the Church of Scientology, and according to series creator Matt Groening he received a call from the Church of Scientology concerned about the use of a similar name. Groening's ''The Simpsons'' had previously parodied elements of Scientology, in the Season 9 episode &quot;The Joy of Sect&quot;. In a review of the episode, ''TV Squad'' later posed the question: &quot;Is the Temple of Robotology a poke at the Church of Scientology?&quot; When ''TV Squad'' asked actor [[Billy West]] about this, he jokingly sidestepped the issue.\n*When Fry and Leela enter the abandoned ride you can see in the corner a heart with the initials H.S &amp; M.B standing for &quot;Homer Simpson&quot; and &quot;Marge Bouvier&quot;\n*The symbol for the church is for a resistor, which is also an inside joke (&quot;resistance&quot;).\n*When Bender is praying in binary, he may be speaking random gibberish as the first letter was an é. He also stated a 2 at the end, although such a number does not exist in binary.\n*The devil in New Jersey is a reference to the mythical Jersey Devil.\n[[Category:References]]"

Further generations of alligators were said to have grown to become albinos, the darkness making pigmentation unnecessary.\n\n*There is a parody of the zealous worship of a nuclear bomb by underground denizens in &quot;[[wikipedia:Beneath the Planet of the Apes|Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]&quot;.

This phrase became commonplace after the Watergate transcripts were publicly released in book form, and the phrase &quot;expletive deleted&quot; was used in place of the profanity uttered on the original tapes by H. R. Halderman and other [[Wikipedia:Watergate|Watergate]] insiders.\n*During the debate, Nixon sweats and appears uncomfortable during the debate. This is a reference to the first televised Presidential debates in 1960 between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. At the time of the debate, Nixon was recovering from a knee injury two weeks earlier. He arrived at the debates in an ill-fitting shirt, and refused make-up that would have hidden his poor pallor and 5 o'clock shadow. Those who heard the debate on radio felt that Nixon had won the debate, while those who watched it on TV felt that JFK won.\n*When Fry asked why Nixon would stay in the &quot;[[Wikipedia:Watergate_Hotel|Watergate Complex]]&quot;, Leela explained that they give you a discount if you've been there before. Nixon took part in the &quot;[[Wikipedia:Watergate_Scandal|Watergate Scandal]]&quot;, which was a failed attempt by president Richard N. Nixon's staff to break into the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate office complex.\n*In the Hall of Presidents, you see Jesse &quot;The Head&quot; Ventura.

The company Nautilus, Inc. produces exercise equipment.\n* In the gym scene, one of the &quot;dirtiest, but subtlest jokes ever on Futurama&quot; (as described by David X. Cohen on the DVD commentary) is seen: [[the Kegelcizer]] machine.\n* When Edna kisses Fry, her facial tentacles wrap around his head in a fashion which is reminiscent of an attack of an Illithid or Mind Flayer from the Dungeons and Dragons game series; illithids, like Decapodians, have four tentacles around their mouths, and wrap them around heads to extract the brains for consumption.\n* The national anthem of Decapod 10 is the same music heard during the fight scene between James T. Kirk and Spock from the Star Trek: TOS episode &quot;Amok Time&quot;. The Song was Titled ''The Ritual / Ancient Battle / 2nd Kroykah''. Several elements in this episode, such as Decapodian mating season and the ritualistic battle to the death also mirror plot details from that particular Star Trek episode. Also the traditional Vulcan lirpa-weapon used in ''kal-if-fee'' is shown as one of the weapons Fry can choose from. ''Claw-plach'' also sounds a lot like ''Qa'pla'', the Star Trek Klingon word for &quot;Success.&quot; This entire sequence was used earlier on The Simpsons on the season five episode Deep Space Homer when Barney and Homer train to be astronauts.\n* When taking bets just prior to the ''Claw-Plach'' fight between Zoidberg and Fry, Bender refers to Zoidberg as &quot;The Great Red Hope&quot;. This is a reference to &quot;The Great White Hope&quot;, Jim Jeffries, who, in 1910 fought Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight boxing champion, in a symbolic racial competition.\n* The restaurant &quot;Red Primate&quot; is a parody of Red Lobster.\n*Bender's story about how he became known as &quot;Honest Bender&quot; is a reference to a similar story by W.C.

He sent it in to a company to see if he could sell the idea but he was rejected.\n*In this episode as well as &quot;The Lesser of Two Evils&quot; it is shown that the people of the future have lost all touch with history, but in the rest of the series they show remarkable knowledge of history.\n*Opening theme promotion: IN HYPNO-VISION.\n\n*Opening theme cartoon: Baby Bottleneck (1946, Warner Bros.)\n*There is a sign that reads 'Orlon Candy' above a stand. Orlon is a synthetic fiber resembling cotton, thus cotton candy. And this is immediately followed by Fry remarking how artificial everything is.\n*Leela pulls the 'Archduke Chocula' cereal box out of nowhere.\n*The redneck farmer's hat reads 'The Moon Shall Rise Again.'\n*Merchandise available at Lunar Park includes a t-shirt that reads &quot;I'm With Stupid - On the Moon&quot;, a bumper sticker that reads &quot;My Other Car is a Porche - On the Moon&quot; and a refrigerator magnet that says &quot;What Part of MOON don't you understand?&quot;\n*The sign that appears during the robot whalers ride reads &quot;Whalers of the Sea of Tranquility&quot;.\n*When on the Moon, there are bails of hay on the ceiling of the barn.\n*One of the Goophy Gophers appears to be missing an eye.\n*There is a man in the &quot;Lunar Park&quot; admissions line with a t-shirt that reads &quot;MOON-U&quot;, possibly meaning that there is a University on the Moon or that the man is wearing a t-shirt with a rude comment on it.\n*The faces on the dollar bills which Bender steals from Amy's wallet are not in the exact centre.\n*Bender stole Amy's money, but she still has some to play the claw game with. This shows that she is extremely rich.\n*While on the Moon in the amusement park, a pink sign in Alien Code #1 appears behind Bender, reading 'TASTY HUMAN BURGERS.'\n*We learn that exposure to magnets messes up Bender's inhibition unit, causing him to sing folk songs.\n*The plaque inside the Lunar Lander reads &quot;Lander returned to this site by the Historical Sticklers Society&quot;.\n*When Fry and Leela were jumping across a &quot;stream&quot; of crocodiles, you can see that they have helmets on, but where do they get their air from?\n\n==Notes==\n*This episode was nominated for an Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Writing in an Animated Television Production.\n*According to the show's producers, and the Season 1 DVD, a scene in an early version of this episode had the Crushinator indicate to her father that she was pregnant with Bender's child.\n*According to rough sketches on Disc 3, Hermes' name was originally going to be 'Dexter.'\n*According to the DVD commentary, the Professor's line about the commercial being aired during the Super Bowl was written when they thought this episode would premiere right after the Super Bowl, but Family Guy took the time-slot instead.\n*According to the DVD commentary, Amy does, in fact, speak actual Chinese when she gets upset.\n*This episode marks the first appearance of Amy Wong, Hermes Conrad, Dr. John Zoidberg, Sal, Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob and the Crushinator.\n==Allusions==\n===Luna Park===\nLuna Park is the name of a real theme park in Australia\n===LEGO===\nThe emblems on Fry and Leela's spacesuits are identical to the emblems on old LEGO astronaut figures. In recent years, they've been making more intricately decorated spaceman figures, but on the old figures, they all had the same gold planet and rocket orbit logo.\n===Apple Macintosh 128K===\nDaisy May 128K is a possible reference to Apple's first Mac, the Macintosh 128K.\n===The Jetsons===\nThe Crushinator looks like one of the robot football players from the animated TV series The Jetsons.\n===The Delphi Bureau===\nThe scene in which the Moon hillbilly chased Bender in the harvester is a direct reference to the TV movie The Delphi Bureau.\n===Star Trek===\nWhen we see the cereal 'Admiral Crunch,' being a parody of Captain Crunch, this is a subtle reference to Star Trek, most noticeably The Next Generation. Whenever we take a look into the 'future,' the Captains are always Admirals.\n===Sleeper===\nThe scene of the dismembered robot heads is reminiscent of the Woody Allen movie Sleeper.\n===Nike===\nThe 'swoosh' Nike logo is able to be seen on the bottom of the boot of the Moon uniforms.\n===Little Hot Riding Hood===\nLulu Bell 7 looks like the &quot;country&quot; version of Little Red Riding Hood from Tex Avery's cartoon Little Hot Riding Hood.\n===Liberty Bell 7===\nThe robot daughter's name, Lulu Bell 7, is reminiscent of the Mercury capsule Liberty Bell 7 which V. Grissom used for the 2nd manned suborbital space flight.\n===Deliverance===\nThe scene with the hilbillies chasing everybody is a reference to the film Deliverance.\n===Cereals===\nCereals seen within the episode include 'Admiral Crunch' which is a parody of Captain Crunch and 'Archduke Chocula' which is a parody of Count Chocula.\n===Apollo 11===\nWhen Apollo 11 first landed on the moon, the phrase &quot;The eagle has landed&quot; was used. The title of the episode, being 'Episode 2: The Series Has Landed,' is a play on that.\n===Kermit the Frog===\nThere is a stuffed Kermit toy in the Stuffed Toy Machine when Bender and Amy are trying to obtain the Planet Express ship keys.\n===Destination Moon===\nThe moon-buggy ride is called Destination Moon, a reference to the Robert Heinlein short story and the 1950 film of the same name.\n===MTV===\nFry refers to the moon flag planted by Neil Armstrong as the &quot;flag from MTV.&quot; A promo using the Apollo 11 landing footage was the first thing shown when MTV was launched in 1981.\n===Disneyland===\nAmy calls 'Luna Park', the &quot;happiest place orbiting Earth.&quot; This is a take-off on Disneyland's tagline &quot;The happiest place on Earth.&quot; Also, a door within the park with a 33 on it can be seen, this is a reference to Disneyland's Club 33, which is the only place within the park where alcohol is served. Also, the first ride the team go on is a take off of the Disneyland Anaheim ride Pirates of the Caribbean. Additionally, the &quot;Goophy Gopher Revue&quot; is presented by Monsanto, a corporation that also sponsored many Disneyland and Walt Disney World ride, specifically many of the Tomorrowland rides.\n===The Red-Neck Stereotype Farmer===\nThe farmer's hat which says &quot;The Moon will rise again&quot; is a parody on the red-neck farmer's saying &quot;the South will rise again&quot;.\n===Life in Hell===\nA rabbit that resembles Binky from Matt Groening's syndicated comic-strip Life in Hell can be seen in the vending machine.\n===The Farmer With Three Daughters===\nBender encounters a farmer on the Moon who has three robot daughters. This is a recurring theme found in jokes ranging from the dirty to the clean variety, but each of them has the same central plot of a young man meeting a farmer who has three available daughters that he is very protective of and never allows to date.\n===Moon Patrol===\nThe security service that throws Bender out of the park is called the Moon Patrol. This is a small homage to the 80's arcade game of the same name.\n===Inspector Gadget===\nBender's arm stretching out is a reference to the way Inspector Gadget's arms expanded and contracted. Also, the way Leela propelled Fry and herself out of the crater using the oxygen from their tank is very similar to how Brain pulled Gadget back to a space station while in space using exactly the same method in the episode 'M.A.D. In The Moon.'\n===The Honeymooners===\nRalph and Alice from The Honeymooners television series are a part of the ride that shows how people came to the moon. The ride itself also depicts how people misunderstand history by taking Jackie Gleason's famous phrase out of context.\n===Alvin &amp; the Chipmunks===\nThe gophers sing and talk a lot like the 1960s version of the Chimpunks, and one of the gophers has glasses like Simon.\n===Games at Lunar Park===\nArcade games seen within the Lunar Park complex include 'Gender-Neutral Pacperson' which is a parody of Pacman and Ms. Pacman. 'Dodecapede' which is a parody of Centipede and Millipede. And lastly, 'Mortal Kooperation' which is a reference to the Mortal Kombat series of games.\n===Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon===\n:'''Fry''': Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!\nJust after Fry says this line you can hear in the background the opening chord to the song 'Breath' from the famous 1973 Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon.\n===Le Voyage Dans la Lune===\nBender poking the Craterface in the eye with a bottle refers to the film Le Voyage Dans la Lune (1902) in which a group of scientists travel to the Moon by way of a large, hollow bullet shot out of a cannon. The bullet flies through space and hits the moon (specifically, the 'Man in the Moon') in the eye. The film, directed by Georges Méliès and based upon Jules Verne's classic From the Earth to the Moon, is considered to be the first in the Sci-Fi genre.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Series Has Landed, The}}\n[[Category:References]]\n[[Category:Season One]]"

It was first aired as the fourth episode of the seventh broadcast season by [[Comedy Central]] on July 8, 2010.\n\nThe episode begins with a news report of a vandalism spree started by [[Bender]], which ends with Bender being arrested. While bailing Bender out of jail, [[Amy]] flirts with several inmates. Infuriated at her obsession with “bad boys and paranoid that she might cheat on him with one of the inmates” [[Kif]] breaks up with her. The break up severely upsets Amy, and to make her feel better, [[Leela]], [[Fry]], and Bender take her to ''Forbidden Planet Hollywood''. Bender mocks her all night, insulting and infuriating her. They end up in bed. After this, Amy and Bender discover a mutual attraction for each other and enter into a [[Robosexuality|robosexual relationship]], which is taboo in 3010, so they keep quiet about their relationship, even to their friends and co-workers. The co-workers grow suspicious, but think nothing of it.\n\nWhile at the planet [[Tornadus]], collecting tornado wind for the [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor]]'s entry for the county fair, the crew is shocked to learn that Bender and Amy are missing. They discover their clothes flying around in the tube with the tornado winds, so the Professor shuts off the machine, and when the winds go away, the crew is shocked to see Bender and Amy making love. Discovering this, the Professor immediately disapproves of it. The rest of the crew accepts Bender and Amy's relationship, which they thank them for, as she knows her family will disapprove. The professor informs Amy's parents of the relationship, then calls [[Reverend Lionel Preacherbot|Reverend Preacherbot]] for Bender. While at her parent's ranch, Amy is saved by Fry, who poses as her new beau to get her parents off her back. Amy saves Bender from the camp that Reverend Preacherbot sent him to. They go back to the Planet Express building, where Bender proposes to Amy. The Professor reminds them that robosexual marriage is illegal in [[New New York]]. To fight against this, Bender and Amy launch a campaign for the legalization of robosexual marriage.\n\nThey launch [[Proposition ∞]], which, in days before the election, slumps in the polls. Amy loses hope, but Bender says that they will win due to his upcoming debate against Professor Farnsworth, the leader of the Prop&amp;nbsp;∞ opposition. At the debate (moderated by the head of [[George Takei]]) Bender gives a heartfelt speech, which the audience applauds. The Professor follows with his rebuttal, saying that he was in love with a fellow scientist named Eunice, and, 43 years later, discovers her in bed with a robot. This does not impress the audience and Amy confronts the Professor for his hatred of robosexuals because his losing his girlfriend to a robot. However, he admits that she was actually a robot, named Unit 47, who slept with another robot. Farnsworth's heart was broken, so he took his anger out on other robosexuals. After admitting the truth, the Professor withdraws his argument, fully in support of Prop&amp;nbsp;∞. The next day the proposition is approved. Amy is ecstatic, saying that she and Bender can have a normal, monogamous marriage now. Bender then leaves Amy for two robot hookers, while Amy goes back to Kif, who assumes a bad boy persona for her.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

Fry finds blueprints to Da Vinci's lost invention. Bender steals The Last Supper, which hides a surprising secret.\n==Plot==\nFry has a habit of failing to think before speaking, which got him ejected from [[Who Dares to Be a Millionaire]]. After initially berating him, the Professor shows him his inspirations for intelligence: statues of histories' greatest minds. Among them is [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Fry accidentally destroys da Vinci's beard, which Farnsworth purchased at an auction, revealing plans for an unknown device that da Vinci had devised. Fry offers to help solve it, to which the Professor laughs at him. Fry then leaves Planet Express, contemplating his IQ, when he was hit by a bus. He spends two weeks in the hospital, at which no one visited him or even sent a card. When he returns to the company, Farnsworth is in the midst of trying to solve the mystery of da Vinci's device. He sent Bender to retrieve a copy of the ''Last Supper'', but the robot had stolen the real mosaic. Examining it, they notice that there is a hand on the painting that doesn't belong to anyone, holding a knife pointed at St. James and beneath him at a strange pair of wooden table legs. Using a high-powered x-ray, they discover that St. James was actually a robot. Realizing that they've come over a three thousand year old mystery, Farnsworth declares that they must go to Rome to figure this out; Hermes tries reminding him that they are just a delivery company, but is ignored.\n\nThe [[Planet Express]] crew races to the future Rome and discover St. James' coffin, confirming that he was actually a robot. Bender tries to pry out his jeweled eyes, only for a mouse to hop onto a wheel embedded in his chest cavity and starts running, causing the wooden robot to reactivate. The robot, named [[Animatronio]], explains that he had actually tossed away the real St. James, to await Leonardo's &quot;Shadow Society of Intellectuals&quot;. The crew then starts prodding him with questions about Leonardo's mysterious invention. Animatronio recognizes the device as the &quot;[[Machina Magnifica]]&quot; but seeing as none of the crew are members of the Shadow Society, he refuses to reveal anything, and begins to flay himself to death when he mentions a fountain. Leela is able to intimidate him into confessing about the fountain, before he spontaneously shuts down. The Professor thinks to quickly give up, before hitting on the epiphany that Animatronio was talking about the Trevi Fountain, deducing the clues from a statue of Neptune. However, the fountain is guarded by an octopus. Bender, determined to collect the coins in the fountain, kills the octopus. He then pulls a giant nickel from the very bottom, only to discover that it is in fact a plug, at which the fountain begins to drain.\n\n[[File:Planet Vinci.png|thumb|231px|Leonardo showing the Professor and Fry Planet Vinci.]]\n\nThe others leap down the tube after Bender, discovering that the tube lead to the Pantheon, fit with a statue of the Vitruvian Man. Meanwhile, a figure in the shadows tries shooting a dart at the Professor, only to miss and hit Bender in the side of his eye, which he doesn't notice. Finding a coin slot which the giant nickel could fit in, Bender attempts to tie it to a string to pull it out, only for his right arm to be pull off. The statue then starts to roll across the floor, which begins to retract to reveal da Vinci's secret workshop. Fry asks if any of these actually work, to which Farnsworth says they don't. Then suddenly, the mysterious figure, revealed to be Animatronio, throws a mace at them, only for it to attach itself to Bender's shoulder, which he uses to whack Animatronio. When they try interrogating him again, he accidentally let slip that many of that many of DaVinci's famous inventions actually fit together, before pretending to die. Fry tries one of the flying craft, determining that it can't fly. Farnsworth warns him that that's dangerous, only to be thrown around by the antiquated machinery onto the chair next to Fry. They soon learn that the craft they're in is in fact a spaceship. Animatronio makes once last ditched effort to stop them from discovering da Vinci's greatest secret with a giant crossbow, only to be tackled by Leela and Bender. The crossbow then fires its arrow at the activation lever, launching Fry and Farnsworth into space.\n\nIt takes a month before they arrive at their destination: [[Vinci]], a planet full of a mix of advanced and steam-based technology. Also, they discover Leonardo, who was in fact a near-immortal alien who came to Earth because he was actually the dumbest of his kind. He is belittled by everyone for not being smart enough to use their civilization's more advanced technology. He could only find solace in inventing, until he lost the designs for the Machina Magnifica, which Fry had on his person the whole time. While the Professor goes to check out the math hall, Fry helps Da Vinci build his lost invention. However, he soon learns that it is not only an ice cream machine, but a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_device doomsday device], designed to slay all the others who have tormented Leonardo over the years. Farnsworth steps up to join him, shouting that though he's stupider than his people, doesn't mean they're smarter than him. Leonardo then unleashes his doomsday machine on everyone. Fry, refusing to let this happen, attempts to nail a nail with another nail to sabotage the machine, only for it to hit him in the eye and cause him to fall into the machine. As he is jammed between gears, he stops the machine. Once again everyone begins to mock Leonardo, who then attempts to restart his machine, only to be crushed by a large gear. Farnsworth and Fry (who is more injured than his last incident) take Leonardo's ship back home. Farnsworth apologizes to his uncle for mistaking his intellect, only to incidentally insult him once again.\n\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

He believes that the back-up unit he was installed with will download him into a new body once his current one is destroyed, effectively making him immortal. His irreverence for death annoys his coworkers, but he informs them that the only human being whose opinion matters to him is that of &quot;Inspector #5&quot;, the quality control inspector at [[Mom's Friendly Robot Company]] who assessed him right after he was built. Though he does not remember him, Bender lauds &quot;Inspector #5&quot;, believing his approved inspection to be the ultimate affirmation of his perfection. However, after discovering and fixing an oil leak, Bender learns that he is missing the back-up unit because of a production defect. Hermes agrees to join him in his quest to discover the identity of [[Hermes Conrad|Inspector #5]], leaving Leela in charge of all bureaucratic business. Unable to understand her first piece of paperwork, she hides it behind a plant.\n\nAfter a fruitless trip to the [[Central Bureaucracy]] where Inspector 5's digital AND physical file were missing, a frustrated Bender calls Mom, who dispatches [[Kill-bot]]s to eliminate Bender in order to cover-up the existence of a 'defective product', which would tarnish her company's image. The duo try outrunning the Kill bots on a train, but they catch up. With a very low tunnel coming up ahead, there is no choice but to limbo while standing atop the train. But Bender couldn't limbo without limbo music. Luckily, the bullets bouncing off his chassis provide the tune. After twelve hours through the tunnel, Bender and Hermes arrive in Tijuana, where they find the old home of Inspector 5. Bender gives up on his search and Hermes gives him a new outlook on life. Bender then puts Hermes on his 'Don't Kill' list (which only includes Fry). Soon, the Kill bots catch up and start destroying the building. Hermes is able to hack into the computer console and upload false information to the Kill bots claiming Bender has been eliminated; he narrowly escapes the wreckage of the house in the Kill bots' wake by limboing. Back at Planet Express, Hermes and Bender return to find it in complete chaos thanks to a panicking Leela who tried to hide every single paper behind plants.\n\nAfter an hour of work, Hermes manages to turn everything to normal and burns various paperwork, among them a file revealing that he is Inspector 5; he actually detected Bender's defect when the 'infant' robot came off the assembly line. However, rather than dispose of the robot Hermes found the newly made Bender just too adorable to destroy, and chose to override the computer and allow Bender to live; he then resigned from Mom's Friendly Robot Company and left his house in Tijuana.\n\nIt is revealed he secretly stole Inspector 5's file while he and Bender were in the Central Bureaucracy; he did not have to hack into the computer at his Tijuana home because it was his in the first place. The ending scene of the episode shows Hermes having a smile on his face, proud of his decision to save Bender. The episode ends with &quot;Little Bird, Little Bird,&quot; an American children's song, performed by Elizabeth Mitchell.\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

While everyone else is dancing, Nibbler &quot;breaks up&quot; with Leela as her pet. Amy wakes up 10 minutes before the exam. She arrives very late and in her underwear. She explains that her thesis is a planetary ratchet that can use the Earth's rotational energy and create electric current. One of the professor's cat starts batting the wire and because of her allergy to cats, she drops her model, breaking. Her doctorate is denied. The cat follows the crew back home.\n\nThe cat is immediately loved by everyone except Amy who is allergic to them, and Nibbler who is jealous. He begins to regret his decision to stop being Leela's pet. However when they find that the cat has Leela under a hypnotic spell and all the crew members have their own cats and are also being controlled. Amy and Nibbler visit Professor Katz to find out more. They discover that he was never even alive! He was just a puppet adapted for control by a cat! They return to Planet Express and sneak into the basement to discover the hypnotized crew members have built Amy's planetary ratchet.\n\nThe main cat reveals that he and all the other cats can talk. He also tells of how his home planet's orbit has slowed making both sides of the planet unbearable. He also tells that the first cats landed on Earth to steal its rotational energy in Egypt in 3500 BC and became domesticated. After learning of Amy's device, he built it to transfer the rotational energy from the Pyramid of Giza they built when they landed. Nibbler tries to break the spell using his own cuteness but it doesn't work.\n\nThe cats stop the planet and send the energy to Thubian-9 (their home planet). They then evacuate the planet as one side begins to reach extreme heats and the other begins to freeze over. They try to spin the ratchet the other way but it doesn't work. Amy realizes that if they continue pushing forward they can restart Earth. They take back the planet's rotational energy and Earth starts turning again and Thubian-9 slows back down. However, the Earth is now spinning in the opposite direction! For saving Earth with her planetary ratchet, Amy is awarded her Ph.D. in Applied Physics. Nibbler apologizes to Leela and he returns to being her pet.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Thanks for the air and whatnot.|Fry}}\n\n'''The Late Philip J. Fry''' is the seventh episode of the [[Season Six|sixth season]] of ''Futurama'', and premiered on July 29, 2010.\n\n== Short plot summary ==\nProfessor [[Farnsworth]] invents a [[Forwards Time Machine|time machine]] that can only travel forward in time, but not back again, hopefully to avoid creating confusing and disgusting paradoxes. This causes [[Fry]], [[Bender]] and Professor Farnsworth to be stuck in the future when the Professor accidentally turns the lever too far.\n\n== Detailed plot summary ==\nBender keeps Fry up all night, therefore Fry oversleeps and arrives at [[Planet Express]] – around the time he is supposed to meet [[Leela]] at [[Elzar's Fine Cuisine]] for her birthday lunch. When he finally arrives, Leela has already eaten both their meals, she then leaves Fry the bill, and storms out.\n\n[[File:Cavern on the Green (Interior) 0030.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Leela stood up inside of Cavern on the Green.]]\nFry tries to make it up to her and tells her he will meet her for dinner at the [[Cavern on the Green]] – although this means he will miss [[Hedonismbot]]'s &quot;Girls Gone Wildest&quot; bachelor party. Just as Fry wants to leave (on time) to meet Leela, the Professor makes him try his new one-way time machine. Fry has gotten Leela a record-a-message card, and says he'll just have to film it in the machine. They are supposed to go one minute into the future but the professor slips and they go [[10,000|7000]] years instead, during which Fry's card flys out the machine's window. Later that night (in the year [[3010]]) everyone at Hedionismbot's party but him dies due to an atomic powered hooker bot meltdown. Leela, having been stood up again, thinks Bender, the Professor and Fry were at the party. She is &quot;sad.. but still angry... is it possible to be both?&quot;\n\nThe involuntary time-travelers try to go forward in time until they reach an era where humanity has developed a backwards time-machine. Meanwhile, in [[3030]], Leela misses Fry and hits on [[Cubert]] for his (perceived) similarity to Fry. Fry, Bender and the Professor, after visiting several eras in Earth's future, involving several parodies of H. G. Wells' ''The Time Machine'', [[252,525|ostrich-riding knights]], a dystopian New New York, and an [[1,000,000½|era of humanity enslaved by giraffes]], then come to [[5,000,000|a future where robots enslave/destroy humanity]] and – of course – Bender immediately likes it. Fry and Farnsworth, however, are not impressed by the mountain of skulls (nor by the gorgeous view over the blood lake) and push the machine forward to [[50,000,000|a future where there are beautiful women]], the few males are in high demand (even the dumb and old ones) and backwards time-travel has been developed. Bender, still angry at Fry and Farnsworth, activates the time-machine again to get even.\n\nForty years after Fry's 'death', ''Planet Express'' has developed into a big and successful company. Leela has found that Cubert is not really like Fry at all, and has divorced him after an affair with [[Amy Wong|Cyborg-Amy]]. Suddenly, Fry's birthday card appears out of thin air as the time machine shoots through time, revealing that that was when it flew out the window. Leela learns that she was angry at Fry for no reason, and that while he is alive somewhere in the future (with Farnsworth and Bender), they won't meet again.\n\nShe goes to the ''Cavern on the Green'' and leaves a message for Fry by shooting holes in the ceiling. The water dripping from the holes will form stalagmites, making the message visible, and Leela hopes that perhaps at some point in the future Fry will see her message. Meanwhile, in the year [[1,000,000,000]], all life on Earth has become extinct. Fry finds Leela's message and seems content with his life. He suggests to skip even further forward in time and watch the end of the universe and Farnsworth and Bender assent.\n\nAfter all the stars explode and the last proton decays, the group gets bored. Surprisingly a new ''big bang'' occurs and a new, identical universe is created. They watch the creation of the Sun, Earth and Moon, evolution, dinosaurs, &quot;history&quot; (Farnsworth also takes the opportunity to vaporize Hitler) and finally arrive back at the time they left. The Professor slips again, however, so they have to &quot;bring her 'round again.&quot; So they take a second trip through time (this time Bender takes the controls, causing Farnsworth to miss Hitler) and on their second approach on the destination time they accidentally crush their alternative selves. Fry rushes off and makes it in time to the ''Cavern on the Green''. As the two stand on a bridge, with Bender burying their time-paradox duplicates underneath, Fry apologizes to Leela for losing her card. She tells him that it is okay, because what she will always remember is their time together.\n\n== Time travel metaphysics ==\nAfter ending the lives of Fry, Bender, and Professor Farnsworth from the final universe they travel to, Professor Farnsworth mentions that they have inadvertently settled a time travel paradox. It is important to note, however, that no actual paradox existed since the trio had traveled into a separate and distinct universe. Had the trio merely waited another minute in temporal flux, the alternate versions of themselves would have entered their own time machine and left on a time travelling journey of their own into the future. Also, since Fry had no interaction with Leela after going on his time journey it would not necessarily stop him from reaching the end of the universe and going around again.\n\nIt has been suggested that the reason for this universe be ten feet lower than the previous universe could be because of the presence of two additional Forwards Time Machines. However, this means that the new universe is not an ''exact'' duplicate of the original, and that would be why the previous universe's Fry, Bender and Farnsworth are capable of preventing the current universe's travel.\n\nAnother possibility also exists - that the trio had in fact skipped past one universe, having 'missed their stop' and that the trio had simply existed in one of the universes that was skipped. This would mean there is always a Fry who is traveling through the time stream of the universe and makes it to Leela's dinner a universe late, and a Fry who gets crushed.\n\nIt can be theorized that the reason the universe repeats itself during the trio's voyage is, in fact, their continued existence following their universe's collapse, even as a time-traveling anomaly, meaning their very presence affects the new universe's formation, namely in repeating the universal timeline resulting in their creation, life and circumstances leading to their flight (Hereby explaining why the universe is an exact duplicate).\n\nTheir presence may also be the actual motivation for the formation of the universe. One thesis for the universe's end involves it settling into a &quot;dark era&quot;, or losing all heat, hereby all energy, and dying, but travelling through time in any direction requires near-infinite amounts of energy, and if the machine's energy was discharged to the dead universe, it could very well have facilitated a second big bang (Being a source of incredibly dense energy). Still, this is pure conjecture.\n\nWhile also conjecture, the fact the universe repeats itself could also explain how Nibblonian civilization existed 17 years before the Big Bang.\n\nThis episode makes Fry even more of an anomaly in time and space than he has ever been before. He was his own grandfather in the universe he was born, gifting him with a lack of a Delta Brain Wave and making his existence cyclical, and now the current Fry is living in a universe that he was not even born into, making him as a time traveller no longer subject to alterations in the time stream anywhere in the current universe. Additionally, Bender and Farnsworth are also not subject to alterations in the time stream.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] asks why he isn't at school. Cubert responds by saying that he couldn't get past the protesters. The [[Planet Express crew]] then sets out to Cubert's school, where protesters are arguing against the teaching of the theory of evolution in schools. Farnsworth argues that evolution did occur, but is ignored because there is one missing link in history that has not been found (although every other link had been found to support evolution). Angered by the protesters' support of Creaturism (a form of creationism where an all powerful &quot;creature&quot; created life), the Professor decides to find the missing link and prove the theory of evolution. After searching for days, the crew eventually finds the missing link. [[Bender]] refuses to believe that [[Robots]] didn't evolve, but the rest of the crew ignores him, with the Professor stating that Robots were just recently built. The crew then presents the missing link (dubbed [[Homo Farnsworth]]) to a museum. Farnsworth is disgraced when an avid Creaturism supporter, [[Dr. Banjo]], reveals a picture of [[Homo Farnsworth]] riding on a Dinosaur at the start of creation, stating that it disproves the theory of evolution. Farnsworth, disgraced and angry, decides that he doesn't want to live on [[Earth]] anymore.\n\nAfter leaving Cubert with [[Dr. John A. Zoidberg|Dr. Zoidberg]], the Planet Express crew sets out to help the Professor set up a house on a distant planet in deep space. After setting everything up, the Professor inserts nanobots into the nearby pond, to clean the irritants in the water. The nanobots then become larger, devouring the ship, Farnsworth's new house, and most of the crew's clothes. The crew hides in a cave, while Bender argues that this proves the theory of robot evolution. The next day, the crew goes outside and sees a newly grown mechanical forest. The nanobots have now become mechanical &quot;dinosaurs&quot;. Robotic versions of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiosaurus Plesiosaurus] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus_Rex Tyrannosaurus Rex] attack the crew, but a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceratops Tricycletops] saves the crew. A robotic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterodactyl Pterodactyl] takes Fry to her nest, where she is about to feed Fry to her robotic young. As the crew attempts to rescue Fry, they are ambushed by a robotic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimetrodon Dimetrodon] and the same robotic Tyrannosaurus Rex, but a solar flare short circuits the robots (except for Bender who was not affected because he was hiding in the cave). The crew salvages the robot parts to build a spaceship, but they must wait until the next day because it is solar powered.\n\nMeanwhile, Zoidberg tries to bond with Cubert, who admits that the reason he makes fun of people is because he's being bullied in school. Zoidberg, knowing full well that he himself had been bullied a whole lot in his childhood and then bullied a ton by his coworkers then gives Cubert advice on how to deal with bullies (by acting cowardly) and the two become closer.\n\nThe next day, the crew wakes up to find both [[Leela]] and [[Amy]] missing, taken and possibly raped by robot cavemen. They go outside and witness the cavemen carrying the women into a cave on top of a cliff. Bender explains that the fittest survived (survival of the fittest) and the Professor makes a slingshot to fight the robot caveman. It takes the professor 12 hours to make the slingshot, so everyone agrees to rescue the women the next day. When the guys wake up, they run out of the cave, ready to combat the caveman robots. Leela and Amy are standing outside the cave and explain that the robots (who wanted them as wives) disappeared after they had went to sleep. A &quot;human like&quot; naturalist robot comes out of the forest and attempts to capture the humans. After realizing that they can talk, she is very excited and so she takes them to the Museum of Natural Robo-History. There, the professor states that he's proud of the nanobots growth after he dumped their ancestors in a pond a few days ago. The robots (who believe in robot evolution) are angered by Farnsworth, and state their Earth took eons, not days, to be created. The professor explains that relative to them, it was eons, but in reality, only a few days had passed. He then shows a picture of a robot (Bender) riding a dinosaur at the start of their creation, thus disproving the theory of robot evolution. The angry robots then arrest Farnsworth for &quot;crimes against science&quot; and he is put on trial. Bender represents him and argues the Professor is not arguing against their evolution, but only claims a small role in applying the initial machinery. Bender calls this insanity and asks the jury to vote not guilty by means of insanity.\n\nThe jurors deliberate for so long that everyone falls asleep. When they wake up, the robots have evolved into a state of higher consciousness, and are not concerned with the Professor anymore. The crew then takes their makeshift spaceship and head home. There, the Professor explains his findings to Dr. Banjo. who agrees that what happened was some form of evolution, but it was set in motion by a wise and all knowing creator (Farnsworth). The Professor and Dr. Banjo then ridicule Bender for wondering if their creator was a robot, and Zoidberg admits he's happy to finally be rid of Cubert, who's &quot;horrible.&quot; Everyone laughs and Zoidberg emphasizes his annoyance with Cubert.\n\n==Footnotes==\n&lt;references /&gt;\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Clockwork Origin, A}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

He reluctantly invades Earth. However, he arrives during [[Comic-Con 3010]], and is mistaken for a costume contest participant and leaves. While at Comic-Con, Fry tries to author a superhero comic book featuring himself as the superhero saving a captured Leela from a malevolent alien. The [[Planet Express]] crew is not impressed with the comic, however, they were impressed with the back page showing novelty toy ads for [[x-ray specs]], [[sea monkeys]], and the Professor's disintegration guns which are actually [[teleportation guns]]. Leela also criticizes the comic, leaving Fry to figure out how to make the story more compelling. Back on [[Omicron Persei 8]], Ndnd learns of Lrrr's failure and kicks him out of the house. Lrrr returns to Earth, seeking shelter at the Planet Express headquarters. The crew diagnoses Lrrr and his marriage problems as symptomatic of a mid-life crisis. Leela encourages Lrrr to recommit himself to his marriage with Ndnd, but instead he listens to Bender and gets plastic surgery, flashy new clothes, and goes out to a club to meet new women. There he meets an attractive female Omicronian named [[Grrrl]]. While on a date, she reveals to Lrrr that she is actually a human woman from Comic-Con wearing an Omicronian costume. Though she is very attracted to real Omicronians. After Lrr gets raped by Grrrl, he rejects her and seeks Leela's advice on how to win back Ndnd.\n\nThe crew help Lrrr stage an invasion of Earth, which is masterminded by Fry, using a fake broadcast with the help of Orson Welles' head à la the 1938 War of Worlds radio broadcast. Despite the stupidity of the plan, Ndnd is fooled, but so are the Earthican army and even President Nixon, who surrenders Earth immediately to Lrrr. Leela scolds Lrrr, demanding that he end the charade and tell Ndnd the truth, but he hesitates due to Ndnd's renewed romantic interest and is forced to invade and enslave Earth for real to save face.\n\nLeela constantly nags Lrrr to tell Ndnd the truth, which causes Ndnd to grow suspicious about their relationship. She confronts Lrrr, demanding to know if he is having an affair in which he is not. Grrrl reappears, announcing that she loves Lrrr and will fight for him, holding a disintegration ray. Ndnd quickly takes the weapon and shoots Grrrl, causing her body to disappear. Ndnd reveals that she is not upset that Lrrr may have been minutely romantically involved with Grrrl, but that Lrrr allowed Leela to nag him, which Ndnd feels is her role and right as his wife. She invokes an Omicronian rite called [[Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or Consequences]] where Lrrr is reluctantly forced to prove his love for Ndnd by shooting Leela, whom he only values as a friend, with the Farnsworth Novelty Disintegrator Ray.\n\nAs he fires, Fry leaps in front of Leela, sacrificing himself. Ndnd is moved by Lrrr's demonstration of love and the two happily depart back to Omicron Persei 8. Leela is devastated by Fry's sacrifice. However, as the Omicronians depart, Grrrl reappears, claiming she'll never love anyone but Lrrr, before hitting on Zoidberg. She reveals that the disintegration gun is merely one of the Professor's novelty teleportation guns that she purchased from an ad in the back of a comic book. Realizing that Fry is alive, the crew finds him back at Planet Express, putting the finishing touches on his comic. Inspired by his own heroic actions, his super hero counterpart attempts to rescue Leela from the malevolent alien by leaping in front of its ray gun. Leela is pleased with the new ending and commends the comic book, giving Fry a kiss on the cheek.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 7]]"

All the main characters end up switching bodies for various reasons.\n\n==Plot==\nLeela accuses Fry of only caring about her looks and Fry tries talk his way out of this argument while Bender interrupts claiming he's going to try to steal the Robo-Hungarian Emperor's crown. Meanwhile, Amy and the professor express a desire to feel young again and give into her voracious apptite respectively, so they switch minds. When they try to switch back they find out they can't because the same bodies can't switch twice. Farnsworth in Amy's body switches with Bender to try and fix it but he realizes it won't work. As the professor tries to figure it out, Amy continues to eat and Bender goes to seduce the guard on board the Emperor's yacht to steal the crown. He finds out the Emperor is tired of the rich life and wants to live a regular life so Bender takes him back to the office.\n\nHowever, the professor decides to run away in Bender's invincible body, and joins the circus as a daredevil. Leela and Amy in the professor's body switch so Leela can get the senior citizen's discount at the movies and Amy can continue to eat because the body of an old man can't digest anything. When Fry finds out Leela gets even more enraged at him about his shallowness. To get back at her, Fry switches with Zoidberg and Fry and Leela get disgusted at each other's appearance but deny it and challenge each other to a romantic dinner. Meanwhile, Bender in Amy's body switches with Scruffy's robotic washbucket and then with the Emperor. Zoidberg in Fry's body and the Emperor in Washbucket's body pretend to recognize each other and they go back to the apartment.\n\nZoidberg rips the dishwasher out of the wall spewing water everywhere and then does the same with the oven to try to boil the water but gas begins to leak as well. The Emperor lights up a cigar causing the apartment to explode. Meanwhile Washbucket in Amy's body tries to seduce Scruffy because she loves him but he reluctantly and nobly rejects her because deep down she is still janitorial equipment. He then starts to cry. Bender discovers that the emperor's fiancee is cheating on him with the emperor's cousin and plan to take the throne. Bender escapes and is chased through the streets under the exploding apartment to the U.N. Meanwhile Hermes discovers Amy in the body of a grossly overweight Leela gorging herself on butter. Amy is depressed because she can't stop eating, so Hermes switches with her to help Leela's body drop the pounds, commenting that she can't really make his body any worse than it already is. At Elzar's restaurant, Fry in Zoidberg's body and Leela in the professor's body are trying to gross each other out and when Fry argues that he's as attracted to Leela as ever he begins to make out with her on the table. Amy in Hermes' body looks on in horror, instantly put off her pork sundae.\n\nAfter returning to Leela's apartment, having sex, and at the same time using their own minds to effectively rape Zoidberg's and Farnsworth's bodies, Fry and Leela turn on the T.V. to discover Bender's situation on the news. Meanwhile, at the circus, Farnsworth meets an old cannon named Big Bertha who loves her old body and wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. As all the Robo-Hungarian carnies watch the scene at the U.N. on the news. Big Bertha launches the professor even though it shatters her body so he can get there in time to save the emperor's body. He crashes through the roof and using the tiny robot carnies he hid in his breast plate, slices the emperor's cousin to pieces. Back at the office, the Harlem Globetrotters help the crew return to their original bodies. They discover Amy helped Hermes' body lose weight after losing her appetite forever after watching the scene at Elzar's. This inspired Hermes' to do the same for Leela's body. In the end, everyone goes back to their original body and Bender realizes he left the emperor's real crown in the emperor's breastplate and begins to think of a new scheme to steal it again.\n\n== Switches ==\nThe order of who got switched into who's body and why is as follows:\n*[[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] and [[Amy]] switch so Amy can pig out in Farnsworth's body.\n*[[Bender]] and Amy (with Farnsworth's mind) switch so that Bender can pull off his heist to take the Emperor's crown.\n*Farnsworth (with Amy's mind) switches with [[Leela]] so that Leela can get a discount at the movies because she &quot;hates paying 14 dollars to watch [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_cage Nicolas Cage] solve things&quot; while Amy can actually digest the food she is gorging herself on.\n*Amy (with Bender's mind) switches with [[Scruffy Scruffington|Scruffy]]'s Washbucket so that Bender and the Emperor can switch bodies. Washbucket agrees presumably for the chance to seduce Scruffy in Amy's body.\n*[[Zoidberg]] and [[Fry]] switch so that Fry can prove that Leela only finds him attractive because of his looks as well. Fry actually uses Zoidberg's body to make love with Leela who was in Farnsworth's body at the time.\n*Washbucket (with Bender's mind) and the Emperor swich bodies so the Emperor can be an Average Joe for a day and Bender can get the Emperor's money.\n*Leela (with Amy's mind) switches with [[Hermes]] because Amy was making Leela fat and Hermes thinks he can lose the weight that Amy gained.\n[[Ethan &quot;Bubblegum&quot; Tate]] and [[&quot;Sweet&quot; Clyde Dixon]] then find out a way to switch minds with everyone to get back to their original bodies:\n*Fry (Zoidberg's mind) switches with Clyde.\n*Zoidberg (Fry's mind) switches with Bubblegum.\n*Clyde (Zoidberg's mind) switches with Zoidberg (Bubblegum's mind).\n*Bubblegum (Fry's mind) switches with Fry (Clyde's mind).\n*Farnsworth (Leela's mind) switches with Clyde (Bubblegum's mind).\n*Washbucket (the Emperor's mind) switches with Bubblegum (Clyde's mind).\n*Leela (Hermes' mind) switches with Clyde (Leela's mind).\n*The Emperor (Bender's mind) switches with Bubblegum (the Emperor's mind).\n*Hermes (Amy's mind) switches with Clyde (Hermes' mind).\n*Bender (Farnsworth's mind) switches with Bubblegum (Bender's mind).\n*Amy (Washbucket's mind) switches with Clyde (Amy's mind).\n*Farnsworth (Bubblegum's mind) switches with Bubblegum (Farnsworth's mind).\n*Washbucket (Clyde's mind) switches with Clyde (Washbucket's mind).\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

The robot was later implanted with the personality of the living Fry by way of the surveillance computers at the [[Planet Express]] headquarters.\n\nWhile constructing the Frybot, Leela put too much copper wadding in its stomach, causing the robot to overload. Leela was electrocuted and left in a coma, and the Frybot sustained several burns; both had their short-term memories erased. The Frybot, then beliving himself to be the original, human Fry, mourned Leela before building a [[Leelabot]] at the same [[Build-a-Bot]] store.\n\nThe human Leela later awoke, and fought with the Leelabot, during which she demanded that Fry shoot the Leela-bot. Fry refused to shoot, being unable to tell them apart (despite the fact that the Leelabot wore a bandage on her arm after having been bit by [[Nibbler]]), and accidentally shot himself, revealing that he, too, was a robot.\n\nThe Leelabot and the Frybot then chose to shed their human skins and live happily together as robots. Their voices unexplicably change at this point, becoming much more robotic.\n\n== Appearances ==\n* &quot;[[Rebirth]]&quot;\n\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One Time Characters]]\n[[Category:Fry family]]"

Also, the posts on Twitter are called tweets while the posts on Twitcher are called twits.\n* The way that Professor exploded Soda and Mentos is impossible to do in real life.\n* When Leela calls Fry, the darkness outside indicated that Leela was in space, but seconds later she is on Earth flying at a low speed.\n* When Fry records Susan in his eyePhone, the viewer can see &quot;REC*&quot; in the eyePhone display, which should be displayed mirrored since the phone is turned to him and we are seeing the back of the display.\n* When a character sends a Twit, it appears to be received sequentially (i.e., one at a time) by his or her followers, which shoudn't happen because every person on-line should receive the message at the same time.\n* In &quot;[[The Late Philip J.

The title is a reference to California Proposition 8 with the &quot;8&quot; sideways, thus becoming the symbol of infinity (∞). The camp where Bender is being reprogrammed parodies conversion therapy camps for homosexuals. The episode also satirizes the people against same-sex marriage, and in particular, the National Organization for Marriage (NOM); the episode depicts an anti-Proposition Infinity advertisement (&quot;No on Infinity&quot;), which is a direct parody of NOM's 2009 &quot;Gathering Storm&quot; campaign. Many of the jokes in the episode were inspired by the actual vote regarding Proposition 8 and similar legislative debates over same-sex marriage throughout the United States, with several critics noting that the episode was favorable toward same-sex marriage.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* The name of the Prison is named Will Riker's Island, as nod to both the real New York Prison and Commander William Riker from ''[[w:c:memoryalpha:Star Trek: The Next Generation|Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', played by Jonathan Frakes (who had a guest shot in [[Where No Fan has Gone Before]])\n* When Amy, Leela, Fry and Bender are sitting in the club, Leela says: &quot;Here's to Amy. Single, Lonely and Fabulous&quot;. this can be a reference to Sex and the City.\n* A hot dog stand turns into a robot, and he calls himself a Transformer. This is a parody of the Autobots and Decepticons from [[wikipedia: Transformers|Transformers (franchise)]] and a reference to transsexuals.\n* Leela contradicts herself in this episode by saying she believes there is nothing wrong with Robosexuals even though when Fry dated a robot she said she thought it was wrong.  Although she could have changed her opinion.\n* [[URL]] references Spock and Rapper LL Cool J's song &quot;Momma Said Knock You Out&quot;, by saying &quot;Momma Said Spock You Out&quot; as he Vulcan-neck-pinches a convict who had taken [[Amy]] hostage.\n* Bender's vandalism spree, where he lays tile mosaics of his face all over [[New New York]], is a reference to the French street artist [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invader_(artist) Invader], who pastes mosaics based on characters from the game Space Invaders to walls in cities all around the world.\n* During the Pride Parade scene, a cartoon similar to the character of Gay Robot, created by comedian Nick Swardson, is seen dancing.\n* When Bender is naming the couples that were allowed to marry, He says at the end of the list &quot;Even Ghost and Horse!&quot; Which is a reference from the Headless Horseman. Apparently, the fact that the last ghost died centuries ago according to Leela in &quot;The Honking&quot; wasn't enough to extinguish the species because one of the married couples seeming to supporting robosexual marriage at the rally is a &quot;ghost-and-horse&quot; pairing. The robot Medium must not have been there or seen them, because she asserts in &quot;Ghost in the Machines&quot; that &quot;...there's no such thing as ghosts, you donkey-monkey!&quot; There we learn of at least three varieties of ghost: robot ghosts, g-g-g-ghosts and &quot;the regular kind&quot; according to the robot devil.\n* The interracial couple shown during the parade is a reference to the Star Trek episode &quot;Let that be your Last Battlefield&quot; Where two species harbour intense hatred of each other, one species has black on the left side of their face and white on the right, and the other species has black on the right and white on the left.\n* Robosexuality must have been tabooed between Season 3 and this episode, other Nappster (the internet site that allows you to download a celebrity onto a robot) would have been illegal. Plus, the Professor frowns on robosexuality in this episode, but is supportive (at first) of Fry using Nappster.\n* The planet named &quot;Tornadus&quot; shares its name with a legendary Pokémon from Pokémon Black And White\n* This is the first episode in which Zoidberg adresses Bender by his name instead of &quot;robot&quot;.\n* Amy's &quot;hunk of the month&quot; calendar has the same days as July 3010.\n[[Category:References]]"

(The Star Trek device was probably alluding to Jane's guides, which are annually published military vehicle and weapon identification guides.)

However, Fry would never get the chance to see movies DiCaprio starred in that were released after 1999 because the Professor told that all films far from the past are extinct.\n* When in the crypts under Rome, Professor Farnsworth finds the number of steps to walk &quot;encoded&quot; using Roman numerals: &quot;II&lt;sup&gt;XI&lt;/sup&gt; - (XXIII x LXXXIX)&quot;. This is 2&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; - (23 x 89) = 2048 - 2047 = 1.

This episode first aired July 29, 2010 and that particular scene of the episode aired at 10:05 PM.\n* Ironically if Bender had just waited until the evening after to use the backwards time machine that the women's civilisation had invented, he could have used it to travel back only as far as the era of robot war, with Fry and Farnsworth going all the way back to where they had begun to travel. But instead he decided to skip over that era by millions of years. Bender is just ''that ''petty.\n* It seems the Time Machine can travel through time, but not through space, since Farnsworth gives up at the death of the Earth, rather than trying on other planets. How ever to note that the sun revolves around the galaxy as Earth to the sun, the galaxy would not have have been in the same place in the universe and therefore by extension Earth would not have been in the EXACT same place inthe universe for it's lifespan.\n* This episode introduces several unusual time travel paradoxes not frequently mentioned in science fiction. Due to the cyclical nature of the timelines and the fact that the time machine cycles through three complete big-bang-big-rip scenarios, we are left wondering what happens to the Fry/Professor/Bender who depart in the time machine in the middle cycle? In the third, they are killed before they take off by the initial iteration of the time machine falling on them, so do they skip ahead two cycles as well and kill the trio again in the fourth cycle? Would they see other iterations of the time machine 10 feet above them if they looked out the windshield, as each universe seemed to be &quot;lower&quot; than the last? And what is the time-machine made of that allows its subatomic particles to maintain their integrity beyond the decay of the last proton? The writers are incredible to pull off such magnificent imaginings!\n* Bender says to Farnsworth &quot;Hand over the keys, Magoo!&quot;. This line refrences the classic cartoon character Mister Magoo, who was old, like Farnsworth and was known for being near-sighted and getting himself into crazy situations because he did not wear glasses.\n\n== Allusions ==\n\n=== The Flintstones ===\nOnce the time paradoxes are fixed, Bender exclaims, &quot;Yabba Dabba Doo!&quot;, which is the popular catchprase of Fred Flinstone from the vintage cartoon, ''[[wikipedia:The_Flintstones|The Flintstones]]''.\n\n=== Mister Magoo ===\nBender\n&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;says to Farnsworth &quot;Hand over the keys, Magoo!&quot;.

This possibly a reference to ''[[wikipedia:Restaurant at the End of the Universe|Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'' by ''Douglas Adams.''\n\n=== Planet of the Apes ===\nThe various Statues of Liberty with different animals is a reference to the 1968 movie ''[[Wikipedia:Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''.\n\n=== In the Year 2525 ===\nThe [[In The Year 2525|song playing during the time-travel montage]] is an adaption of the 1969 hit song &quot;[[Wikipedia:In the Year 2525|In the Year 2525]]&quot; by ''Zager &amp; Evans''. Similar to the time in the episode, the song tells tales of later and later centuries and finally concludes with the first verse again and fading out\n\n=== Terminator ===\nThe year ten million, where robots enslave and/or kill humanity, is a reference to the 1984 movie ''[[Wikipedia:The Terminator|The Terminator]]'' which also features time travel.\n\n==Continuity==\n*The time machine in this episode is the unfinished one in &quot;A Clone of My Own&quot;\n\n== Footnotes ==\n&lt;references /&gt;\n[[Category:References]]"

It is the first in a set of four such episodes, the others being [[Reincarnation]], [[Naturama]], and [[Saturday Morning Fun Pit]]\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn every story, all earthlings die, exception made for the Robanukah story in which Bender survives and the Kwanzaa episode in which only the crew dies for sure. This kind of disregard for continuity was never before experienced in the Futurama series, if not within the stories in the &quot;[[Anthology of Interest I]]&quot; and &quot;[[Anthology Of Interest II|II]]&quot;, from which this episode also takes the three-stories setting.\n\nAlso, in every episode someone sings a song about the holiday traditions. [[Santa]] for [[Xmas]], [[Bender]] for [[Robanukah]] (first mentioned in [[Fear of a Bot Planet]]) and [[Kwanzaabot]] for Kwanzaa.\n\n[[Al Gore]] makes an appearance in every storyline and in the final wrap up with [[Amy]], advertising, for the fifth time in the episode, [[Gundersons Nuts]].\n\n===First story===\n[[File:The Xmas story from episode 6x13.png|thumb]]\nThe first story is about [[Xmas]]. Fry is gloomy because he still didn't understand the Xmas holiday, therefore Santa explains it in a song. When they realize they do not own a pine tree, as Xmas tradition would require, they want to get one. Pine trees are extinct, except they seem to ski with them in the beginning, therefore, they go to the [[Svalvard Global Seed Vault|Svalbard Global Seed Vault]] in Norway, right next to the Germ Welfare Repository. They then are able to obtain a seed for the pine tree, which appears to be contaminated with germs and Fry plants it in front of the [[Planet Express Building]]. One year later, it has grown not more than six feet and [[Nixon]] steals it in order to replant it in front of the White House to celebrate the annual White House Christmas lighting. And right after the lighting, the tree starts growing huge and shooting pinecones on the ground, reforestating planet Earth. This brings very high levels of oxygen. This is when Bender says: &quot;I don't recall doing anything for a while, but I still think I deserve a smoke!&quot;. When he lights his cigar, the oxygen in the air catches on fire transforming the whole earth into a ball of fire.\n\n===Second Story===\n[[File:Robanukah tradition to wrestle in petroleumoil.png|thumb]]\nThe second story is about Robanukah. Bender is upset because everyone gets excited about holidays but not about Robanukah. When he is accused to have invented Robanukah himself just to skip days of work, he makes up a song in which he describes Robanukah traditions. One of these is to watch two fem-bots wrestling in petroleum oil. Unfortunately, there is no petroleum left on earth. The professor states there should be some petroleum deep down towards the center of the earth. They therefore modify the [[Planet Express Ship]] in order to dig through ground. They finally go too deep and all the crew but Bender is crushed due to the intense pressure. Bender then sits singing &quot;Bender is great&quot; for [[500,003,010|500 million years]]. When he looks back to the crew, he finds out they finally turned into petroleum oil, &quot;I thought they were selfish, but in the end, it turns out it was I that thought they were selfish!&quot;, so he climbs back to surface and celebrates Robanukah with the two fem-bots wrestling in lots of petroleum oil, generated from the whole population of earth being extinct and the planet being now a desert.\n\n===Third Story===\n[[File:Immagine 4.png|thumb]]\nThe Third story is about Kwanzaa. The crew gathers at the [[Hermes Conrad|Conrads]]' place to celebrate Kwanzaa. This is when they want to know more about Kwanzaa, so [[Kwanzaabot]] sings a song about it and it's traditions. They therefore find out they have to light some candles, which have to be made 100% out of bee wax. All bees on earth are attacked by parasites and cannot produce any bee wax. [[Fry]] then suggests to go on the planet of the [[Space bee|space bees]] and so they do. Once there they see how all the bees are crushing against walls and floors and exploding. The queen bee then explains that they have been attacked by parasites themselves and can't do anything but just talk smack to eachother. [[Hermes]] wants to stop this bee on bee conflict and decides to africanamericanize the space bees. He tells them about the values of Kwanzaa, about unity. Hermes' speech about Kwanzaa brings back the Kwanzaa spirit, which kills all the parasites. Now the space bees are united again and turn against the crew, killing Kwanzaabot and making them into candles to celebrate Kwanzaa.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

Fry received the message in the year [[1,000,000,000]] and continued on through time watching the universe end and then be born again. After another run through time, Fry managed to make his reservation with Leela at Cavern on the Green.\n\nThe Cavern on the Green was first seen in [[A Leela of Her Own]] when the Planet Express crew played blernsball against the [[Cygnoids]]. It did not appear to be a restaurant, but rather a picnic area in Central Park.

Part of the episode was read by the Futurama voice actors at the San Diego Comic Con.\n==Synopsis==\nThe Professor invents a machine that takes in any object and creates two half-sized copies, consuming matter provided to it in order to do so. He uses the machine to create a number of sweaters suited to his shrunken, old-aged self and sets Bender on the task of folding them. Bender looks for a shortcut and creates duplicates of himself using the machine to do the job for him. This soon escalates and eventually there are trillions of increasingly smaller copies of Bender creating copies of themselves until eventually they threaten to consume all of the matter on Earth.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-YoutubeComicCon2010FuturamaPanel_0-3&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benderama#cite_note-YoutubeComicCon2010FuturamaPanel-0 &amp;#91;1&amp;#93;]&lt;/sup&gt;\n==Plot==\nProfessor [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] invents a machine that can scan an object and produce two smaller copies, consuming matter provided to it in the process. He uses it to make smaller sweaters for himself, since he is shrinking and feeling colder as he ages. [[File:BenderDuplicates.png|thumb|left|Can anyone see a Robot in this room named 'Folder'.]][[Bender]] originally refuses the professor's request to fold them, then stuffs the replicator into his chest cavity and uses it to make two duplicates of himself so they can each fold one sweater. Before they can do so, the [[Planet Express Crew]] (including the two new Benders) is sent to deliver a shipment of personal hygiene products to an ugly, [[Giant Unattractive Monster|giant alien humanoid]] who lives in a cave. He endures the crew's comments about his appearance until [[Fry]] inadvertently insults his mother, causing him to lash out and nearly destroy the ship before it escapes.\n\nBack on Earth, Bender's two duplicates laugh about the funny comments they made until Bender wants some cigars. So They copy themselves in order to get four cigars for Bender. The process continues until there are 11 generations of Benders running around the office; the crew quickly moves in to exterminate all the duplicates, but [[Amy]] discovers that one of them has escaped. As this one gives rise to a new swarm that keeps reproducing and consuming matter, including Bender's couch and beer, the Professor worries that they will eventually eat the Earth. [[Leela]] points out that since the Benders are fueled by alcohol, they will run out of power once they have used up the world's supply. When this happens, the crew sweeps up the Benders and flushes them down the toilet.\n\nAs the Professor takes a bath, he is surprised to find that the water in the tub has turned into alcohol. Some of the Benders survived and have reached the atomic/molecular scale, where they can synthesize alcohol directly from water and carbon dioxide molecules. As a result, the entire population of Earth becomes extremely drunk and the planet's fresh water supply is gone. At this point, the giant alien arrives on Earth to apologize for his earlier outburst, even though the crew keeps insulting him and [[Zapp Brannigan]] tries to destroy him with a tank.[[File:BenderGiantFight.png|thumb|Bender and the Giant fight.]] Unable to get hold of the therapist who has been helping him deal with his anger issues, the alien flies into another rage and starts tearing up the city. Bender, the only sober crew member, agrees to fight the alien if Fry will fold the Professor's two sweaters. Bender uses the hordes of tiny duplicates to form &quot;Big Bender&quot; and fight the alien hand-to-hand. He loses the fight after insulting the alien's mother, but the swarm quickly consumes the alien to leave only dust. Bender urges them to help him solve other worldwide problems, but they are too lazy to take part and leave Earth instead.\n\nAs the other crew members recover from a terrible hangover the next morning, the Professor is happy to note that someone finally folded his sweaters. When Fry asks Bender if he did this and learned a lesson about being lazy, Bender cryptically replies that perhaps he did - or perhaps he kept one of the mini-Benders around to do the job for him. He then exhales cigar smoke, which turns out to be composed of thousands of microscopic, maniacally laughing Benders.\n\n==Production==\nThe first act of the episode was read by the show's voice actors at Futurama's 2010 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic_Con San Diego Comic Con] panel.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-YoutubeComicCon2010FuturamaPanel_0-4&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benderama#cite_note-YoutubeComicCon2010FuturamaPanel-0 &amp;#91;1&amp;#93;]&lt;/sup&gt;\n\n==Guest stars==\nPatton Oswalt as Giant Unattractive Monster\n\n==Trivia==\n*The formula that the Professor shows representing the mass of the successive generations of Bender is an iteration of the Harmonic Series, which is divergent. This means that the sum of all generations gets larger without limit, and that it would be theoretically possible for the combined mass of all the Benders to be infinite.\n\n==References==\n#^ [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benderama#cite_ref-YoutubeComicCon2010FuturamaPanel_0-0 &lt;sup&gt;'''''a'''''&lt;/sup&gt;] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benderama#cite_ref-YoutubeComicCon2010FuturamaPanel_0-1 &lt;sup&gt;'''''b'''''&lt;/sup&gt;] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benderama#cite_ref-YoutubeComicCon2010FuturamaPanel_0-2 &lt;sup&gt;'''''c'''''&lt;/sup&gt;] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benderama#cite_ref-YoutubeComicCon2010FuturamaPanel_0-3 &lt;sup&gt;'''''d'''''&lt;/sup&gt;] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benderama#cite_ref-YoutubeComicCon2010FuturamaPanel_0-4 &lt;sup&gt;'''''e'''''&lt;/sup&gt;] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benderama#cite_ref-YoutubeComicCon2010FuturamaPanel_0-5 &lt;sup&gt;'''''f'''''&lt;/sup&gt;] TheGeekEvan (2010-07-25).

Fry|Fry's]] sneezes reintroduce the common cold to the world of the future.\n==Plot==\nBecause Fry has flashbacks of himself and his Dad going ice fishing in 1988, the [[Planet Express crew]] go ice fishing. They don't have much luck, and after a whole day of no bites, they go back to the headquarters with only a baby fish - and a common cold. [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] explains that the common cold has been extinct for more than 500 years. Soon after, a quarantine shield is put on top of the [[Planet Express]] building, and everyone (except Bender) catches the cold. Although [[Bender]] is needed to help the others during their illness, he escapes with germs on his hands, caught from [[Dr. John Zoidberg|Zoidberg]] accidentally sneezing on him. He then congratulates the quarantine crew, shaking their hands, and giving them the germs. The quarantine crew soon catches the cold, and there is a new outbreak.\n\nAfter 99% of the city gets the cold, a bigger quarantine shield is put on the city, which is then lifted physically out of the ground. Using tractor beams, the island of Manhatten is carried towards the Sun, towed by the starship Nimbus. The professor says that developing a vaccine is possible, but it requires the unmutated 20th century cold virus which only Fry has. As Fry is attached to a machine, preparing to be sliced gruesomely into a thin paste (to obtain a sample of the virus), he has a flashback of a high school science contest that he had entered. His entry, (A common cold virus contained in Fry's pet hamster) lost to a boy in Fry's class who also used the common cold (preserved and cultured immaculately) as his experiment, which was subsequently sent into space.\n\nIn the future, Fry remembers this and stops himself from being pureed.  Fry recalls that the experiment was shot into space, carried on a satellite which was sent to one of the frozen moons of Saturn as a garbage dump. They initially cannot escape their confinement since the barrier is too strong to yield to the weapons of the crew. They devise a plan where they trick the Nimbus into attacking them. As the Nimbus shoots at the Planet Express crew, they swerve and are able to exit through the substantially sized hole now produced in the quarantine shield, thanks to the power of the Nimbus's weapons. The crew finds the experiment on Saturn's moon under the ice, perfectly preserved. Since the virus culture was professionally prepared and the experiment sealed untouched under the ice for over one thousand years, the Professor is able to engineer a vaccine. Farnsworth administers vaccinations to a very long line of New New Yorkers, waiting for their turn, including Ogden Wernstrom.﻿\n\nAt the end of the episode, Fry has one final flashback showing him and his father in the ice fishing shack after he gets pulled out of the ice by his father.  Fry and his father talk, and during the conversation his father shows one of the first, if not the only, signs of love towards Fry in the series. Fry's father offers him a beer, which Fry accepts. His father admits he has been tough in raising his son, but tells him that it was only because he wanted Fry to grow up to be strong, and able to face whatever adversity he is presented with. He speculates that Fry may one day experience adversity so great, it would have been inconceivable to him before, alluding to his eventual experiences in the future. Fry's father ends the episode by placing a warm jacket on a shivering fry, along with the words &quot;I don't want you to get frozen.&quot; This is a very touching and sad comment, as it can be interpreted as Fry literally being frozen a few years later, losing his entire family in the process.\n\n==Production==\nTo be added\n==Guest stars==\nTo be added\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

The machine is only capable of traveling into the future, specifically in order to avoid creating temporal paradoxes such as [[Roswell that Ends Well|accidentally having sex with one's grandmother]]. However, this purpose finally failed, as a consequence that, in the series, the time is cyclic, what means that the universe can start again, allowing make changes in any moment of history in which machine stops.\n\n[[Fry]], [[Bender]], and Professor [[Farnsworth]] initially intended to test the machine by traveling one minute into the future. The Professor slipped while manning the control panel, however, and inadvertently transported to [[10,000|the year 10,000]]. Because the machine had no reverse-time-traveling function, the three were marooned in the future until they decided to continue further down the timeline, hoping that a Reverse Time Machine would eventually be invented.\n\nFarnsworth, Bender, and Fry then proceeded to use the machine to travel to several points in the future, including the years [[105,105|105105]], [[252,525|252525]], [[351,120|351120]], [[1,000,000½|1000000½]], [[5,000,000|5000000]] and [[5,000,005|5000005]], [[10,000,000|10000000]], and [[50,000,000|50000000]].

They eventually reached the last moment of time at [[10 E 50]] and witnessed the expiration of the universe, after which they were stunned to see the [[Big Bang]] occur again.\n\nThey then watched the universe form anew, and traveled forward through history toward the moment in 3010 when they left the original timeline.

Mr. Astor giving up his seat on the &quot;lifeboat&quot; for Leela's grandmother and great-grandmother may be a reference to Alfred Vanderbilt, a wealthy passenger on the Lusitania, who gave his life belt to a young woman and her child, though he himself could not swim.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The song performed by [[Devo]], &quot;Beautiful World&quot;, is shown to be sung by Mark Mothersbaugh in concert, but the recording used features bassist Gerald Casale on vocals.\n*When Fry crawls out of the Land Titanic, a can of Angry Norwegian anchovies can be seen on the ground.

It is also a parody of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlebots BattleBots].\n*The commissioner of the Ultimate Robot Fighting League is a parody of Vince McMahon.\n*The referee is a stripe-painted alien that is the [[Amphibiosans|same species]] as [[Kif Kroker]]. Besides the obvious physical resemblance, he also announces the beginning of the first fight, &quot;Ladies, Gentlemen, and [[Smizmar]]s!&quot; which seems to indicate a link to that people.\n*The characters who serve as Bender's opponents are typical of many pro wrestling characters that have appeared over time on World Wrestling Entertainment. For instance, Billionaire Bot is a parody of The Million Dollar Man, while The Foreigner is a jab at such personified racial stereotypes as The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff.\n*&quot;RobotMania XXII&quot; is a parody of WrestleMania, and possibly a reference to the Super Bowl's use of Roman numerals in its annual titles.\n*The Masked Unit's line, &quot;I'm gonna open a file of whoop-ass on you!&quot;, is a parody of a catch phrase of former wrestler &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin.\n*In a crowd scene a fan is seen wearing a &quot;Bender 3:16&quot; T-Shirt.

Also, a [[Smizmar]] is a term used in &quot;[[Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch]]&quot; to describe the person who caused the feelings of love allowing a male of Kif's species to become pregnant.\n*The opening to ''All My Circuits, The Movie'' is a parody of James Bond films, in particular ''The Spy Who Loved Me.''\n*Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo from ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' appear in silhouette in the movie theater as they normally do on their TV show. Crow's harsh demand that Fry not talk during the movie is an ironic statement since the entire crux of their show is to talk during the movie. Neither Joel Robinson nor Mike Nelson can be seen though, and Crow is not voiced by either Trace Beaulieu nor Bill Corbett. Furthermore, Fry's comment of 'Oh, this is SO futuristic' is a reference to MST3k's brand of making fun of various problems in the B-movies that the show often reviews.\n*The ad announcing Bender's persona change to &quot;The Gender Bender&quot; starts with Bender standing on the planet Earth with the Earth flag waving behind him. This pose is identical to the George Reeves Superman pose at the start of each episode of the 1950s television series ''Adventures of Superman''.\n*The Loews theater the crew goes to is called the ([http://images.wikia.com/wikitex/images/6/68/685/ee5d3a8b3621a4bcd26c72ddb05c11.png])PLEX, a reference to the first aleph number, the least infinite cardinal number, and dubbed on the commentary for the episode as the nerdiest joke ever on television.\n*Hermes' brain slug could be an indirect reference to the slug-like young ceti eels that Khan uses on Chekov and Terrell in ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' (although in that case, they enter through the ear, but still affected the brain). Hermes first encountered a brain slug in an earlier episode, ''[[A Head in the Polls]]''.\n*Master Funog is a parody of sensei Miyagi from the Karate Kid series of movies.\n*When the fight rages out in the middle of the theater, [[Hattie McDoogal]] shouts &quot;let's all go to the lobby!&quot;. This is a reference to the 1953 animated snipe, &quot;Let's All Go to the Lobby&quot;.\n*Bender's line, &quot;Float like a float bot, sting like an automated stinging machine.&quot; parodies Muhammad Ali's famous quote, &quot;Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.&quot; Bender also references how he is going to be the greatest, and Ali's nickname was &quot;The Greatest.&quot;\n\n[[Category:References]]\n[[Category:Season Two]]"

This song is best known for its inclusion in Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey''. The song was the first information programmed into Hal 9000 the ship's computer, and he sang it as he was being disconnected.\n\n===2001: A Space Odyssey===\n\nThere are two additional references to ''2001: A Space Odyssey'': As Fry enters the internet, the famous 2001 theme ''Also Sprach Zarathustra'' by Richard Strauss is played and moments later, he references Dave Bowman's line &quot;My God, it's full of stars!&quot; from the ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' novel by saying &quot;My God, it's full of ads!&quot;\n\n===Married... with Children===\n\nParts of this episode are a spoof of ''Married... with Children'', which also starred [[Katey Sagal]], who is the voice of Leela. Leela dresses, does her hair like and acts like Peggy Bundy. Similarly, Alkazar acts like Al Bundy. Leela in fact refers to him as 'Al' several times and his friends act like the uproarious studio audience.\n\n===The Shadow Out of Time===\n\nOne of Alkazar's four other would-be brides appears to be a member of the Great Race of Yith, a species of time-travelling body-snatchers from the H.P. Lovecraft story, ''The Shadow Out of Time''.\n\n===Games===\n\nWhen Fry is on the internet playing a video game reminiscent of 2-D sidescrollers:\n\n*Fry jumps and shoots some crates and a ''Donkey Kong'' look-alike.\n\n*When he jumps he makes noises similar to the sounds ''Mario'' makes in his 3D video games.\n\n*He also quickly tucks and rolls through a small space, almost exactly like the Morph Ball from ''Metroid.''\n\n*Fry also shoots a laser from his arm, much like Samus from ''Metroid.''\n\n===Charlie Chaplin===\n\nA scene where Bender falls into a machine and slips between gears is a references to the Charlie Chaplin film, ''Modern Times''.\n\n===Superman===\n\nThe story about the destruction of Cyclopia and the planet's greatest scientist sending a Cyclopian baby, Leela, to Earth is a reference to the origin story of Superman, where, before the destruction of his home planet Krypton, master scientist Jor-El sends his only son, Kal-El, to Earth. Leela, like Superman, is supposedly the last member of her race.\n\n===TRON===\n\nThe Planet Express crew entering cyberspace may be a reference to ''TRON''.\n\n===Star Wars===\n\nThe Professor's head appearing as a giant blue hologram may be a reference to the Emperor's appearance in ''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back''.\n\n===The Birth of Venus===\n\nAlkazar's castle resembles Angkor Wat and the mosaic of the goddess resembles Sandro Botticelli's ''The Birth of Venus''.\n\n==Alienese==\n*The [[Alienese]] signs read, &quot;Plump Juicy Humans Web&quot; and &quot;Codebreakers Chat Room&quot;.\n\n&lt;references/&gt;\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bicyclops Built for Two, A}}\n[[Category:References]]\n[[Category:Season Two]]"

Unfortunately, the ship sank. Mrs. Astor thought she lost him, but she would later discover he had actually been safe the whole time.\n\nIn September of [[3010]], she ordered a soufflé (with a few drops of nitroglycerine) from [[Elzar's Fine Cuisine]]. The [[Planet Express crew]] was hired to deliver it to her. After meeting the crew, she invited Professor [[Farnsworth]], [[Fry]], and [[Leela]] to a fundraiser all the best families would attend.\n\nAt the [[New New York]] Historical Society building, she told the story of how she (thought she) lost Mr. Astor. That story would justify the creation of the Annual Astor Endowment Fundraiser, which supported the United Mutant Scholarship Fund. However, the fund wasn't meant to help the sewer mutants, but to keep those hideous creatures busy so they wouldn't ask for equal rights. During a conversation, Fry accidentally revealed Leela was actually a mutant, rather than an alien, and Mrs. Astor called the police to have her arrested and sent to the Sewers.\n\nMeanwhile, Fry and Leela had joined forces with a revolted army of Mutants and found a way to send all the sewage back to the surface. As the largest campaign contributor, Mrs. Astor demanded that Mayor [[Poopenmeyer]] cleaned up streets of New New York, now fully covered by a green sea of garbage. The Mayor solved the problem by ordering an Antarian to pump it into Madison Cube Garden. Strangely, it didn't stop there. The mutants came onto the surface and asked for freedom.\n\nMrs. Astor didn't agree on giving it to them, but a mutated Fry emerged from the ground and showed her a priceless quantum force generald the crew has discovered in the Sewers which carried a love message from Mr. Astor, as well as the Land Titanic's original passenger manifest. She then learned he risked his life for a mutant. Wanting to pay him one last tribute, Mrs. Astor persuaded the Mayor to give them what they wanted. A few minutes later, Mr. Astor would appear only to reveal he had been living in the sewers after being mutated by a taste of Lake Mutagenic water. They hugged, celebrating their reunion.\n\n== Appearances ==\n* &quot;[[The Mutants Are Revolting]]&quot;\n\n[[Category:Characters]]"

The ale was brewed inside Bender so he resembled a pregnant robot.\n==Gestation Period==\nBender resembled a pregnant robot mimicking all the signs of pregnancy. At first all the ingredients were boiled inside Bender while he sat on the stove reading a magazine called Victoria's Circuits. When Bender burped, foam came out of his mouth and Leela tasted it saying that it was cooked. Leela added the yeast by unscrewing the antenne at the top of his head and adding a funnel. Upon revealing that yeast was needed Bender emotionally exclaimed; 'Yeast? You mean... I'll have a life form growing inside me? It's so beautiful.'\n\nAfter returning from a fake pizza delivery on Dog Doo 8 Cubert accused Leela and Fry of brewing bootleg beer inside company property. Bender exclaimed 'Lies! Lies and Slander!' and then burped a foamy burp but the Professor took Bender's side saying 'accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw!'\n\nBender is next seen on the couch in Planet Express stroking his swollen bump saying 'I'm really starting to swell up with beer, I must look ridiculous.' Fry replied; 'No. You have a healthy glow.' Bender then exclaimes 'Oh my God! I just felt it ferment!' Leela and Fry rush over to feel it, placing their hands on Bender's bump.\n\nAfter Leela asks what he thought to name it Bender runs through a list of names&quot; 'BenderBrau' if it's an ale. 'Botweiser' if it's a lager. Fry states that he hopes its a lager so he can take it to a ball game.\n\nBender is then seen at the conference table knitting with pink yarn and an apparently larger bump. After which Bender is seen on the couch again with Fry and Leela watching TV and stroking his bump.\n\nBender, Fry and Leela are now working for Dwight and Cubert after receiving a better offer of pay. All three are then seen in the Awesome express conference room when Cubert and Dwight revoke the building. Bender with and even huger bump. The three are now working on the paper route with Bender shifting papers and rubbing his back.\n\nLater on the couch Bender is seen singing 'hush little brew-ski don't you leak. Daddy wants to drink for a least a week.' Bender's bumps rumbles and Bender shouts 'Oh my God! I think it's time!' Fry then tells Leela to 'Get some coasters and cold mugs!' Bender is then seen on the conference table with a tube coming out of him while Fry fills some bottles and Leela pats his head. Fry then tells Bender it is an ale. 5 gallons 6 ounces. Then the bottles are placed in an ice box and given to Bender.\n\n==Childhood==\n\nBenderBrau bottles all have labels on them and are shared around Hermes Conrad, Professor, Bender and the father blob when Hermes and the Professor are in hospital.\n==Translation==\nThe word 'BenderBrau' is German. In English, it means 'Roaring Bender', which might be a refrence to Bender's 'Explosive' belches.\n==Esoterica==\nWhile they say the beer is an ale in the episode, the label says it is &quot;Cold-Fusion Steam Beer&quot;.  &quot;Steam&quot; is a term trademarked by Anchor Brewing company for a style of beer brewed with lager yeasts at ale temperature.  Other beers in this style are called &quot;California Common&quot; and considered a hybrid of ale and lager.[[File:BenderBrau.jpg|thumb|Let's Get Drunk.]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Food]]"

[[Bender]], however, imitates Amy's voice proposing a Planet Express 'girly' calendar.\n\nLeela and Amy refuse to pose topless but have to change their minds when Hermes declares that it is in their contract. Due to the low number of female employees (only two) Hermes hires his wife [[LaBarbara]]. After the photoshoot, Amy wearing a skimpy lab coat and tight clothes, Leela going topless, and wearing suspenders &amp; LaBarbara wearing another skimpy outfit, that was taken using Bender as the camera, the Professor dismisses the idea saying that they still don't have enough female employees reverting back to Leela's idea of an Airline company, but claims the idea to be his own.\n\nPlan Am is launched and Fry and Hermes are in charge of piloting the plane with the women acting as stewardesses. On their first journey Fry and Hermes sleep causing the plane to crash on a mineral world. When arguing if Hermes or LaBarbara should be in charge, [[Rock Alien|a native lifeform]] offers to help solve the problem by offering a series of tests. The men win the first test helped by Bender's lies. The next test is to find their way to the cave of harmony which is the only safe place to reside when the Planet reaches its nearest part of the orbit around the sun and becomes too hot.\n\nNeither gender reaches the cave in time thanks to negative traits of both genders, the men get lost and refuse to ask for directions while the women are unable to resist a mirage that looks like a shoe sale. Hermes and LaBarbara sneak into the opposite camps to steal Bender's gas compressor and Amana's freon with the same idea of supercharging the freon with the gas compressor in order to keep cool. However Hermes and LaBarbara meet in-between both camps and discovering each other's theft declare both genders to be equal. They start arguing and then suddenly start to have sex and the next morning wake to find that they have overslept. The women start coughing from the fumes and the men are engulfed by boiling Mercury.\n\n[[File:620-Sleeping.jpg|thumb]]\nEverybody then suddenly materializes in a cave and the rock alien is disappointed with them saying that he set the test so both genders would work together and their failure to do so means that he lost his bet with the [[Borax Kid]]. He then decides to remove their genders and everyone finds that their sexual organs have been removed. Everyone is much happier with no gender and get along much better, but Hermes and LaBarbara decide that they want their genitals back when they see that without genitals they can't have sex. The rock alien returns to restore their genders but inadvertently changes them to the opposite gender so the women become men and the men become women. Just as he is about to rectify his mistake, [[Zapp Brannigan]] arrives and shoots him and then starts to chat up the now female Fry.\n\nBack at Planet Express headquarters there is a majority of female staff so the 'girly' calendar can now go ahead. The calendar makes enough money to put Planet Express back in business and the Borax Kid arrives and returns the crew back to their correct genders. Just after the Borax Kid leaves, [[Scruffy]] comes out of the girls toilets still as a women asking what (s)he missed.\n\n==CCinsider Sneak Peeks==\n\n&lt;gallery&gt;\nNeutopiasp4.png|Photo Shoot Storyboards\nNeutopiasp3.png|Planet Express Ship dressed as an airplane\nNeutopiasp2.png|Fry, Amy, and Leela sleeping together\nNeutopiasp1.png|Female Zoidberg\nNeutopiasp5.png|Female Scruffy\n3_big.jpg|The crew &amp; passengers meet the large rock monster\nNeutopia5.png|Female Prof' Hubert Farnsworth\nF3.jpg|Other Genderbents\n.jpg|Mans\n&lt;/gallery&gt;\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

During this time Amy screams 'A Giant Sausage!' and points to a floating sausage outside the window and the rest of the crew become terrified. But Leela realizes that it was part of the parade that was happening today and all the crew calm down except Fry, who starts to scream again. So the crew all go outside to watch the parade and Fry is surprised to discover that this is parade day parade, where different cultures have a single float and specified section to march in.\n\nThe Jamaican Float travels too fast bumping into the back of the Dorrito float and causing a giant dorrito to cut the heads of the lampposts and the model Earth on Zapp's float which rolls down towards two nerds who are talking inconspicuously and unaware of what is happening. Fry then charges forward and lunges towards the nerds saving the human one and leaving the robot to die. Fry is thanked by the survivors wife and the mayor declares that this Saturday should be declared Fryday in honor of Fry's actions as well as giving him the keys to the city.\n\nAfter the celebrations they arrived back to Planet Express to discover Bender glowering at Fry and accusing him of thinking that a human's life is worth more than a robots. Bender then decides to kill himself which the crew doesn't take seriously as for Bender this is a common empty threat. Bender arrives to the suicide booth to discover the booth is Lynn, an ex-girlfriend of his, who says his death won't be suicide; it will be murder. At Planet Express his dead body is returned all the crew mourn after Hermes proves that he is dead by waving a $1 over his nose.\n\nBender rises from his body as a ghost and finds that no one can hear him any more except the robot devil who takes him down to his office for a chat where they agree that if Bender kills Fry then he will get his life back but if he fails he spends the rest of his life in robot hell as Fry thinks a human life is more valuable than a robots'. Bender tries to scare Fry to death but as Fry cannot hear him it doesn't work. After trying to kill him with soap Bender discovers that he can control electronics and begins to torment Fry with electrical devices. The crew laughs at Fry when he claims to be haunted by a ghost but after more mishaps he holds a seance and the medium tells him he is being haunted by a robot ghost and he wonders what robot it could be. He then calls reverend Preacherbot to help him who gives him a sacred firewall which prevents robot ghosts from getting 20 feet near him.\n\nHowever Bender manages to possess the firewall and cause an image of Fry's melting head which causes him to have a heart attack. Believing the heart attack to be fatal Bender goes down to hell to claim his prize but the robot devil informs him that Fry survived his heart attack. Back on the surface, Bender overhears that one more sudden shock will kill Fry but changes his mind about murdering his best friend when Fry says that he misses Bender and that he realizes how valuable a robot life can be when it belongs to his best friend.\n\nFry goes to live on the Amish homeworld where no machines are allowed. Bender follows, vowing to help his friend and assisting him with everything even though Fry is unaware. On the day the Planet Express crew visit the Robot Devil comes to criticize Benders failure dressed in Granny Hester's clothes. The Robot Devil says that it is Bender's fate to kill Fry and causes him to unintentionally spook the ox into making the circular barn roll towards Fry. Bender possess the Robot devil and warns everyone to run away from the barn pushing Fry out the way but killing the robot devil in the process. Fry then decides to return to New New York.\n\nHowever the robot devil has a steady supply of spare bodies and ridicules Bender for trying to kill him. But, because of his good deed, Bender is risen up to robot heaven where he meets the Robot God and tries to possesses him but he is instead ejected back to Earth. His old dead body reassembles and he is once again alive. Fry says he is glad that Bender is alive again and that he missed him but then asks suspiciously if Bender was the one haunting him to which Bender doesn't reply.\n\n==Production==\nTo be added\n==Guest stars==\n[[Dan Castellaneta]] as The [[Robot Devil]]\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

In this new role, he participates in a car chase with imagery drawn from the 1982 film ''[[w:c:tron:TRON|TRON]]'' and an intelligent reference to the physics puzzle of [[wikipedia:Schrödinger's cat||]]. Successful in apprehending Erwin Schrödinger, Fry is promoted to the Future Crimes Division. At this point in the episode, the story veers into the plotline and imagery of the Philip K. Dick's 1956 short story, ''The Minority Report'' and its [[wikipedia:Minority Report (film)|2002 film adaptation]] by Steven Spielberg. But Fry doesn't know what to do when Pickles (their Cyborg Oracle) predicts Bender stealing deadly booze. The Oracle then shows that if Fry doesn't shoot Bender, Bender will accidentally kill their friends by sharing the deadly booze with them.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens with Delivery Boy Command being played by [[Fry]]. Fry narrates saying &quot;As being a delivery boy for centuries, nothing surprises me.&quot; A bus then hits Fry and the game is over. Much like &quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot;, [[Zoidberg]] says, &quot;You stink, loser!&quot; And [[Leela]] then says, &quot;Fry, pizza goin' out, come on!&quot; (Much like [[Mr. Panucci]]. Fry then rides his bike and gets hit by a bus once again. The scene jumps to Applied Cryogenics where Fry goes into the same room he got frozen in. He then says &quot;Hello, pizza delivery for, D. Frosted Wang?&quot; [[Terry]], Imju and the other worker come out laughing. Fry then angrily says &quot;Its not as funny as the first time anymore!&quot; Imju claims it's not AS funny, but still funny. Fry then tells his story to the crew and they all laugh. Fry says he needs to be shot in the arm. He is then shot in the leg by [[Roberto]], who jumps through the window to hide after a robbery. Officer Smith then tells &quot;The criminal robot in the building, come out with your hands up!&quot; [[Bender]] then yells &quot;Never!&quot; Smitty, then claims he means Roberto. He then claims he wants certain items such as a hovercopter and that every five minutes he doesn't get one someone will be stabbed in the ass. Zoidberg then states he's bluffing only to be stabbed in the ass and yells &quot;He's not bluffing!&quot; [[Smitty]] and [[URL]] then break in saying, &quot;You called for a chopper?&quot; and Roberto, exclaims he specifically ordered a hovercopter. URL says &quot; One chopper, coming up&quot; and knocks Roberto out. They proceed to arrest him, and [[Amy]] and Zoidberg give Smitty a kiss. Leela tells Fry she loves a man in uniform. Fry says he's in uniform, and Leela states she means a uniform that doesn't involve short pants. Fry then resigns, takes off his shorts, gives them to [[Hermes]] and walks off. He goes to the police academy to get a job there and meets [[Sound Effects 5000]]. The future officers rise for [[Chief O'Manahan]] who states it's a hard job and if they pass she'd be proud to call them policemen. The scene jumps to Fry's training where he rides in a police car, shoots targets and hits dummies with a lightsaber.\n\nThen, the graduation ceremony begins with Fry becoming a police officer, along with many others. Once Fry is a policeman the chief states he will be working with URL due to the unfortunate loss of Smitty a few days before retirement. URL states he took an early retirement.\n\nAt Planet Express, the [[Professor]] states his new invention, wheels on a board, so Bender and Leela can make the next delivery without him. The Professor also states that they will be going to [[Pandora]] and they can't send their avatars because it's cheaper just to have them die.\n\nIn the streets of New New York, Fry and URL chase a car through [[Circuit City]] for going 15 MPH over the speed of light. In reminiscent of Tron, they catch the law-breaker with their lightwalls and identifying one Erwin Schrödinger, who has kept a cat and drugs hidden in a box. Impressed with their work, O'Manahan promotes the two of them to the Future Crimes Division.\n\nMeanwhile on the trip to Pandora, Bender and Leela discover that, without Fry, working for a delivery company isn't actually that interesting, and they say nothing to each other for the entire 27 hour flight. They then land on Pandora. Leela tells Bender to deliver the package, Bender then gets mad telling Leela he's the ship's cook, not the delivery boy. So Leela tells him to cook them something nice. Bender then comes out with a sandwich that splats on the screen. Words then appear saying put 3-D glasses on one minute ago.\n\nBack on Earth, URL and Fry then get a tour of the Future Crimes Division, and get introduced to [[Pickles]], a robot equipped with an advanced human brain that can predict crimes in advance before they happen. The tour guide then explains that a green ball states larceny, a black ball states fraud, the red ball states homicide, and the pink polka-dotted ball states clown slaughter, which happens a lot. A red ball (homicide) then appears. The guide then goes to the holographic computer area finding the suspect, the victim ([[Hattie McDoogal]]) and the time (5:08). Hattie McDoogal and her boyfriend are romantically sitting on the couch when the cops bust in and her boyfriend picks up the snowglobe and Hattie yelling &quot;My Ka-Jigger!&quot; He hits the cage and the parrots fly everywhere. They then arrest the suspect. As they explained to Hattie, her boyfriend wasn't intent on marrying her, since she promised her valuables to her parrots, whom he intended to marry.\n\nWhile Fry is alone in the Oracle Room when Pickles alerts him to a new crime about to made: larceny. He finds a case blown up, Maltese liquor, a gunshot, and the suspect, Bender. Fry attempts to warn Bender not to go through with it but accidentally makes Bender decide to rob Hedonismbot.\n\nFry then returns to the Oracle Room, looking through the prediction and sees himself shooting Bender. URL walks in, talking to Fry. Fry states he would never shoot Bender. This creates an alternate future in which all of his other friends die because the Maltese liquor is fatal to humans, which Bender decided to share. However, Fry decide to have one last look.\n\nThen we see Bender ringing a doorbell at the house of the crime. [[Hedonismbot]] answers and allows Bender into his basement. A dog then comes out barking at Bender. He then distracts the dog with a steak and slaps it across the dogs face. Bender lights up a cigar revealing the invisible safe. Then with the dynamite he used to light his cigar, he breaks the safe open. Fry walks in with the gun. Bender refuses to put the Maltese liquor back. Bender trying to make a chump out of the future, states he wont steal anything. Fry claims the oracle was wrong. Pickles then walks in with a gun asking &quot;Was I?&quot; Fry shocked asks &quot;Pickles?&quot; He says it was all a setup. Everyone would think Bender was the thief so he could steal the Maltese liquor and kill his human brain cells to end the misery of being an oracle. Pickles, then orders Bender to hand him the real Maltese liquor that he switched around when Fry wasn't looking. Pickles orders Fry to shoot Bender and the fake bottle. Fry shoots at Pickles in which the bullet bounces off the invisible safe and shoots Bender. Pickles then shoots Fry. Pickles then drinks the liquor and the human brain shrinks. Fry and Bender stand up. Pickles, confused, then finds out Fry and Bender had bullet-proof vests. Then the chief and URL get it all written down and Pickles is arrested by Fry who states it was all a setup. He became suspicious when Pickles showed him Bender sharing the liquor with his friends, as Bender is not the sharing type. Fry later presents the Planet Express crew with the detective shield awarded to him for stopping both Pickles and Bender, but says he was immediately fired for tipping Bender off in the first place. The Professor offers to hire Fry back as &quot;Executive Delivery Boy&quot;, which Fry accepts, even though Hermes notes &quot;Executive&quot; is &quot;a meaningless title to help insecure people feel better about themselves&quot;.\n\n==Goofs==\n*Fry cannot join the police, due to [[career chip]]s.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by Josh Weinstein, and directed by Stephen Sandoval. On May 20 and 21, as part of its &quot;Countdown to Futurama&quot; event, ''Comedy Central Insider'', Comedy Central's news outlet, released various preview materials for the episode, including concept art of the Future Crimes division, a storyboard of Fry making a delivery to a cryogenics laboratory and a 30-second preview clip of the episode. Originally entitled &quot;Frynority Report&quot;, the original concept for the episode's plot featured a mysterious man travelling backwards in time, who would eventually be revealed to be Fry and Leela's son. Weinstein and series co-creator David X. Cohen spent time elaborating and working on this concept before the idea was scrapped after the writing staff concluded the plot &quot;wasn't funny enough&quot;. &quot;Law and Oracle&quot; features the first appearance of Chief O'Mannahan, the police chief of the New New York Police Department. Cohen has called her one of his favorite characters of the show's sixth season. An additional backstory between her and her love interest, URL, was scrapped from the episode. The sequence involving Bender and Leela making a delivery to the planet Pandora contains anaglyph 3-D graphics, as a reference to the moon of the same name from the film Avatar (2009), a film noted for its similar use of 3-D imagery. The 3-D graphics used in &quot;Law and Oracle&quot; may or may not work, depending on the type of 3-D eyeglasses used by the viewer.\n\n==Guest stars==\nTo be added.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n\n&lt;!--Interwiki links--&gt;\n[[es:Law and Oracle]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

He secretly makes out with the Donbot's daughter Bella when he witnesses the Robot Mafia viciously beating [[Calculon]]. Being the only witness of the attack, but fearing repercussions from the Robot Mafia, Bender tries to disguise himself while testifying against the Donbot in open court. However, he is recognized by Bella, while Calculon is threatened by the Robot Mafia into testifying in favor of the Donbot's innocence.\n\nNow targeted by the Robot Mafia for ratting out the Donbot and his affair with Bella, Bender is forced to go into witness relocation, leaving Planet Express to begin hiring for his replacement. Determined to hunt down Bender, the Donbot sends Robot Mafia member Clamps to apply for Planet Express under his real name, Francis, in order to befriend [[Fry]] and make him reveal Bender's location. However, he is unsuccessful and earns the resentment of [[Zoidberg]], who fears that Clamps's masterful use of his clamp-like hands will overshadow the use of his own pincers, the only part of Zoidberg's job that makes him feel appreciated.\n\nThe Planet Express crew makes a delivery to the moon where they find a robot they believe to be Bender, who claims his name is [[Billy West (character)|Billy West]] and does not seem to remember any of them, his memory seemingly erased as part of the witness relocation program. This does not stop Clamps from attempting to kill &quot;Billy,&quot; but he is stopped by Zoidberg, who uses his pincers to cut off his clamps. However, Bella arrives and shoots &quot;Billy&quot; to death, accusing him of cheating on her since he is married to the [[Crushinator]]. The crew returns to Earth to mourn Bender's apparent death at a pizzeria near the Planet Express building. There they find Bender working as a waiter, revealing himself to still be under witness protection there, and realize that Billy was a different, innocent robot. With the Robot Mafia believing Bender to be dead, Bender is freed from witness protection.\n\n==Production==\nTo be added\n==Guest stars==\nTo be added\n\n== Trivia ==\n*When Zoidberg and Clamps fight on the moon, it's a bit like in the episode [[Why Must I Be A Crustacean In Love?]] when Zoidberg challenges Fry to [[Claw-Plach]], then cuts off his arm.

Mr. Peppy grows to full size in a few days, and Farnsworth discovers that Mr. Peppy is a ravenous Bone Vampire. Realizing they can't keep it on Earth, they send it back to its homeworld, Doohan 6, to repopulate the species.\n\nAfter setting Mr. Peppy free, the crew goes to a nearby barn where they tell the villagers that they set the creature loose, thus threatening the populace. Leela's friend Angus McZongo spearheads the hunt as Fry assures them that Mr. Peppy is harmless. After Leela is attacked by Mr. Peppy, Fry decides to kill his pet himself. When he shoots, however, it is revealed to by McZongo dressed in a bone vampire costume, and admits that he was responsible for the attacks. Suddenly, they notice Mr. Peppy sucking the skeleton from some sheep, and Fry decides to kill him until the villagers spare the beast because they can use it as a clever way to slaughter their excessive livestock without having to debone them.

It first aired August 4, 2011.\n\n==Synopsis==\nLeela hunts a mysterious four-dimensional whale.\n\n==Plot==\nFarnsworth is mourning the loss of his first Planet Express Crew, having it been exactly 50 years since they were lost, with Dr. Zoidberg as the only survivor of the incident. Zoidberg was so traumatized by the event that he suffered short-termed amnesia and grew white hair. To commemorate the anniversary, Farnsworth orders the current crew to pick up a memorial and fly it back to Earth. However, on the way back, there is the Bermuda Tetrahedron, which is thought to have killed the lives of many spaceships which have travelled through it. But Leela insists that they should fly through anyway.\n\nIn the spaceship graveyard inside the Bermuda Tetrahedron, the crew spots the old Planet Express Ship, where they find the crew to have been gone. However, inside the old ship, the crew is attacked by a four dimensional space whale (which Leela refers to as a 'Möbius Dick'), and they flee to their current ship. The whale re-attacks them, eating their monument and engine, but leaves the ship afloat.\n\nLeela orders the crew to set the sun-wave sails to replace the spaceship engine. But instead of fleeing the Bermuda Tetrahedron and telling Farnsworth what went wrong, Leela decides to hunt down the whale and does not listen to any of her crewmate's warnings. Her obsession with killing it, eventually means the crew with the exception of Zoidberg, who went back to Farnsworth in an escape pod to tell him what happened (only to forget again), is eaten by the whale, wherein the whale consumes her. Inside, she finds the first and the current crews swimming around in the whale's colon. The only one who isn't is [[Lando Tucker]], the captain of the first Planet Express drained of his vitality and fused to its belly. He explains to Leela that the whale feasts on obsession, especially on spaceship captains obsessed with killing it. Leela denies his claims, even as he tells her that the whale is obsession, and she ''is'' the whale, as she too is fused to its belly.\n\nBack on Earth, Farnsworth is forced to go ahead with the memorial. However, the whale suddenly appears over Planet Express and out of its mouth steps Leela. She explains to everyone that while the whale fed on her obsession to kill it, an overriding obsession to complete her delivery enabled her to take control of it. On cue, she commands the whale to launch the statue out of its spout, accidentally crushing a vendor. She then release all of the whale's victims, who hadn't aged a day within its colon. Despite acknowledging that the space whale is not a monster, as it merely follows its instinct, everyone proceeds to kill the whale out of revenge for swallowing them.\n\n==Production==\nTo be added.\n==Guest stars==\nTo be added.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n\n&lt;!--Interwiki links--&gt;\n[[es:Mobius_Dick]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

Turns out, Farnsworth forgot that he signed the license agreement due to being too lazy to read it over in order to get Bender to bend a straw for him. At trial, Cubert and the Professor are ordered to locate Bender, and are forced to pay $10,000 every day until he is found, threatening to bankrupt Planet Express.\n\nMeanwhile, Bender continues to gather processing power, eventually gaining deity-like intelligence and powers, enabling him to anticipate future events, such as Mom sending robots to capture him to restore him to factory settings. Bender sets an elaborate trap involving a microwaved turkey, a volleyball net and Zoidberg to beat these robots and steal their processing chips, increasing his capacities even further. The side-effect of this is that Bender requires an extreme amount of coolant to prevent himself from overheating, causing him to leave Planet Express to find another, larger source of coolant.\n\nMeanwhile, Leela feels like her relationship with Fry is in a rut and leaves Planet Express to become a space real estate agent. Depressed, Fry talks with [[Randy Munchnik]] about Bender's disappearance. Despite Randy's suggestion that Bender would probably go to a place with a lot of coolant and power, Fry decides to commit suicide by falling of Niagara Falls in a barrel. But amazingly, he finds himself in a cave underneath the falls, where Bender has developed into an omnipotent being, using the waterfalls as his new cooling system. Fry tries to convince Bender to help Professor Farnsworth and Cubert, but Bender is unconcerned with their troubles, stating that they are guilty and will be convicted. Fry asks Bender if he has a future with Leela, but Bender does not answer and tells him to leave.\n\nAfter Fry returns to the trial, Bender has a change of heart and appears in court, accusing Mom of unfairly trying Cubert, a minor. Fearing that Cubert will gain the jury's sympathy, Mom drops charges against Cubert while still attempting to prosecute the Professor. However, Bender seeks a mistrial on the grounds of double jeopardy, declaring that by dropping charges against the Professor's clone, Mom is unable to press charges against the Professor for the same crime because they are legally the same person. Enraged that she cannot prosecute the Professor, Mom forcibly captures Bender and resets him to factory settings. As he is carried away, Fry asks Bender about his future with Leela. Bender says there's no time, but proves he has enough to trick Zoidberg into getting hit by a ceiling fan.\n\nAs Bender has been restored to factory dumb-setting, Leela returns to Fry, who still wonders what the future holds for both of them. Bender reveals that he had written down his prediction of their future, which Fry and Leela silently read together. The contents of the prediction are not shown, but Fry and Leela's reactions indicate that their relationship will have its ups and downs but will ultimately have a happy ending.\n\n==Production==\nTo be added\n==Guest stars==\nTo be added\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

Fry is trying to find a perfect diamond for a ring he wishes to give to Leela, but he doesn't think one big enough exists. When the crew is sent to destroy the comet Fry finds a part of the comet shaped like a cut diamond but unfortunately dimondium is indestructible. Taking one of Professor Farnsworth's doomsday devices and setting it on the comet, he hopes it will break loose the piece he seeks.\n\nThe comet passes in front of the sun causing a rainbow, but the Doomsday Device going off causes half of the comet to break off and drift near the rainbow, causing the creation of an entirely new color (which cannot be seen due to the animation being black and white) and a very small portion of the comet lands on Leela's hand. As Fry kneels down to offer the ring to Leela, he wishes that they could stay in that moment forever, and the entire area promplly becomes frozen in solid diamond. The section of the diamond containing Fry and Leela is then shown to be used as the diamond for a ring that an alien uses to propose with.\n\n''Second Segment: '' The second part of the episode is rendered in the style of an 8-Bit video game. Professor Farnsworth calls the Planet Express crew around the table and informs them of a major breakthrough he will soon be able to reach using a lens made from the Dimondium Comet. He holds up the lens but Bender promtly destroys it (causing a ghost to rise from it like traditional game death) however he simply takes out another.\n\nPlacing the lens in a microscope he observes a fossilized log very closely, and eventually determines the makeup of all life and [[Smallest Matter in the Universe|the answer to the universe]] ; all life is made up of pixels. At first Professor Farnsworth is elated that there are no more mysteries to solve, but as time goes on he realizes with no mysteries to solve his job no longer has merit and begins to conclude his life isn't worth living. Close to giving up, Fry offers a question to the Professor: Why physics work the way they do and not some other way? Realizing this will allow him to research once more he begins to plan for this experiment.\n\n''Third Segment: ''The third part of the episode is in Anime style format and begins with an action-oriented scene of the Planet Express crew preparing themselves. A pink race of aliens that communicates only through dancing become enraged when the Diamondium Comet is destroyed by Earth's forces, and when the Planet Express tries to communicate they mean no harm to the aliens, their message isn't understood because the aliens only understand dancing.\n\nFry and Bender try to communicate through a DDR dancing sequence, but unintentionally send a hostile message to the aliens, but Zoidberg steps up claiming to be able to help. As usual the crew tries to shrug him off but he rises on a pillar and sheds his shell, making his body limber enough to do the complex moves necessary to communicate with the aliens. With peace returned the aliens leave, and the adventure is deemed over but the crew is certain that &quot;We'll be here again at this exact time next week!&quot; and the episode ends with each of them suddenly donning jetpacks and flying into the sky.\n\n==Production==\nAn episode featuring 3 different segments, in the same vein as episodes such as [[Anthology of Interest I]] and [[The Futurama Holiday Spectacular]]. Each segment showcases a different style of animation. The first segment will be animated in &quot;a black-and-white Fleischer style&quot;, the second segment will be in the style of a low-resolution video game, and the third drawn in the style of anime. The episode will not be canon, and will be the final episode of the eighth broadcast season of ''Futurama''.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

He invites the [[Planet Express]] crew to the museum for a party, where they become drunk and begin ingesting the preservative fluid inside the jars. Doing so causes them and everyone standing nearby to temporarily travel back in time to the eras each head originally came from. [[Professor Farnsworth]] reasons that this time travel effect is caused by the rare powdered crystalline [[opal]] used to make the fluid, which keeps the heads alive in a temporal bubble. After learning from [[George Washington's head]] that one of his own ancestors, [[David Farnsworth]], was one of American history's most nefarious traitors during the American Revolutionary War, Professor Farnsworth becomes determined to salvage his family's reputation. He dumps the world's entire powdered opal supply into Washington's jar and licks his head, transporting himself, Fry, [[Leela]], and [[Bender]] back to colonial-era New York.\n\nThe four learn from the [[Continental Congress]] that David Farnsworth works at [[Benjamin Franklin's head|Benjamin Franklin]]'s print shop in Philadelphia, where David would forge counterfeit money that would threaten to destroy the country's economy should it enter circulation. Though they do not find David at the shop, they discover a fake Massachusetts halfpenny and determine he has gone to [[Paul Revere]]'s silver shop in [[Boston]]. They capture David just as Revere begins his ride to alert Lexington of the imminent British attack that would start the American Revolution. However, Fry takes one of the two lanterns hung at the Old North Church to burn the forged money, causing Revere to wrongly warn of the British attack &quot;by land&quot; rather than &quot;by sea.&quot;\n\nThe four are suddenly sent back to [[3011]] and find that history has been altered: Great Britain has won the Revolutionary War and taken over all of [[North America]], turning it into &quot;West Britannia.&quot; In this alternate timeline, David Farnsworth killed George Washington and was rewarded with a dukedom, making Professor Farnsworth a noble landowner and consort of the Queen of England. Having depleted the world's crystalline opal supply, Farnsworth despairs that there is no way to travel to the past to fix their mistake until he notices an opal on the queen's crown. After stealing and crushing it, the four are able to use the preserved head of David Farnsworth to return to colonial times and restore the timeline. Once they return to 3011, everything is restored as it was before history was first altered, with one change; hanging in the Head Museum is a flag displaying Bender and a colonial spelling of his catchphrase &quot;Bite my shiny metal ass&quot; in place of the Gadsden flag.\n\n==Production==\nTo be added. \n[[File:Image.jpg|thumb|Doctor Who TARDIS]]\n\n==Guest stars==\nTo be added.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

However, she is informed that the orphans ate all of their books long ago (being unable to afford food), leaving nothing left to read. Leela tries to improvise a story on the spot, but does a poor job of it, and the orphans are vocal in their disappointment. Dejected by her failure to entertain them, Leela decides to try and write a children's story of her own, but is unable to concentrate in the noisy [[Planet Express building]]; so she takes the [[Planet Express ship]] to another, unseen planet where she will be able to write in peace.\n\nLater, Leela returns to the orphanarium to tell her new story; she has invented a whimsical fantasy setting named &quot;[[Rumbledy-Hump]]&quot;, which is inhabited by cartoonish creatures called &quot;[[Humplings]]&quot; who sing moralistic songs. While the children are initially reluctant to listen, fearing Leela's new story will be just as bad as the others, but they are quickly won over by her latest effort, and eagerly ask her to return to tell another story. Leela is then approached by [[Abner Doubledeal]], now working as a television producer, who was watching her presentation from another room. Doubledeal had earlier subjected the orphans to a test screening for a new lineup of children's shows, but none of the flashy, fast-paced, and corruptive programs, which teach very bad morals caught their interest; in contrast, the simple, colorful, and good moraled world Leela created was able to hold their attention. Doubledeal proposes adapting Rumbledy-Hump into a basic cable television series. Leela hesitates, wary of the heavy corrupting influence of Hollywood, but when the orphans encourage her to further develop something that brought them so much joy, she accepts. Leela arrives late for the filming of the first episode of the Rumbledy-Hump series, having just returned from her &quot;quiet place&quot; with the script in hand. Production goes smoothly, and the episode airs just as planned, with the costumed members of the Planet Express crew acting as the main cast and Hermes as the cameraman. Leela is proud of the work they've done, although she expects little to come of it, claiming that good television series are always canceled... sometimes two or three times. However, when the next day's television ratings arrive (from the future), Rumbledy-Hump is revealed as a sleeper instant smash hit, and its popularity explodes all over Earth; the show is adapted into a series of books and children's toys, and Leela becomes famous overnight. She is awarded a Slurmie award for her show at the Slurm-sponsored &quot;Young People's Choice Awards&quot;, and attends a celebration that evening, although her newfound fame has caused a change in her attitude; Leela has become snotty and arrogant, regarding herself as a creative genius, and disregarding all of her friends' contributions to the show.\n\nWhen Doubledeal tells Leela that he needs the script for the next episode, despite the late hour, she takes the Planet Express ship to her &quot;quiet place&quot; in order to work on it. A dazed [[Bender]] stumbles out of the ship, having seduced a fembot at the party, and discovers Leela observing a group of aliens who are identical to the Humplings; it turns out that Rumbledy-Hump is actually a real place, and is the planet that Leela has been retreating to all this time. Bender learns that Leela never actually wrote any of the scripts for her show; she stumbled upon Rumbledy-Hump while searching for a quiet place to write, and has merely been transcribing the words and actions of the native Humplings, then claiming it as her own work, which counts as plagiarism and is a crime. Bender admires Leela's hypocrisy, although he swiftly blackmails her, threatening to expose her as a fraud unless she shares half of the show's gross profits with him.\n\nFilming of the show continues as normal until Leela is approached by [[Sally]], who shows her a simple drawing of her own magical cast of characters from a place called &quot;Butterscotch Hollow&quot;. Leela is surprised that Sally was able to develop an original setting using her own imagination (when Leela herself could not), but Sally replies that Leela's work serves to inspire her. Overcome with guilt from this, Leela takes the crew, Doubledeal, and the orphans to the real Rumbledy-Hump planet, where she confesses that all of her scripts are plagiarized from the life experiences of the Humplings. She admits that she should have come forward sooner, but she took great pride in being able to make the orphans happy, and didn't want to disappoint them.\n\nDoubledeal is shocked to learn that the Humplings are real, but quickly turns the situation to his advantage; rather than make a Rumbledy-Hump adaptation using scripts and actors in suits, he simply films the Humplings directly as a reality television show. Leela is outraged by what she perceives as the exploitation of the innocent creatures, but the arrangement is actually a beneficial one. The Humplings are introduced to the conveniences of modern technology, greatly improving the quality of their lives, while Doubledeal himself adopts all of the orphans, putting them to work as the show's production crew and providing them all with full-time jobs. Leela, however, is still wracked with guilt, and has developed a psychological need to be criticized for her deception, demanding to be &quot;punished&quot;. She cries out in despair as the assembled children and Humplings sing and dance around her, proclaiming their love and appreciation for her.\n\n==Production==\nTo be added\n\n==Guest stars==\n*Tom Kenny\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

The professor refuses, and the crew question why Zoidberg was ever employed in the first place. A series of flashbacks reveal that Zoidberg first met and befriended Farnsworth in 2927, during a mission to kill a Tritonian yeti for Mom's bioweapons research. As they parachute out of a spacecraft, Zoidberg asks Farnsworth if everyone had taken their hypermalaria pills. After setting up camp, Zoidberg determined that everyone but himself had contracted hypermalaria, a fatal, incurable disease which can either strike instantly or remain dormant for years. With all of Mom's mercenaries doomed to die as well as himself, Farnsworth decides to kill the yeti himself. Zoidberg chased after him and together they killed the yeti. As a favour to Farnsworth for killing the yeti and saving his life, Zoidberg agrees to an arrangement: when Farnsworth begins to experience symptoms of the disease, Zoidberg will have to perform a mercy killing before the disease can fully manifest. As a result, Zoidberg was employed by the professor for the sole purpose of carrying out this task.\n\nIn the present, the professor begins to experience the symptoms of hypermalaria. The Planet Express Crew enters Zoidberg's office in a mob fashion and starts yelling at him and bullying him. Professor Farnsworth tells Zoidberg to come to his office, and the crew thinks that the Professor is going to fire Zoidberg. The Professor instead tells Zoidberg that the hypermalaria is starting to kill him after 80 years, and insists that Zoidberg must kill him by surprise because Farnsworth prefers it that way. Zoidberg attempts to kill the professor multiple times but all the attempts fail and backfire. The crew catches Zoidberg attempting to mercy kill the Professor, and restrain him with the professor's lab coat, then imprison him in his own office. Zoidberg cuts himself loose from the coat and then notices a single white hair on the professor's coat. Upon examining it, he has a revelation.\n\nMeanwhile, Farnsworth berates his employees for their interference and explains about his arrangement with Zoidberg. The crew returns to Zoidberg's office to free him, but he had already escaped from his office prison by &quot;sandcrabbing&quot; his way out.  Zoidberg goes to Mom's, exchanging a coupon for a free tanning session for the &quot;thing&quot; from Triton.\n\nBack at Planet Express, the crew decide to kill Farnsworth themselves, using an elaborate and way overdone mechanical Rube Goldberg killing machine called The Murdolator. The machine works with a wheel covered with axes on a metal grid that surrounds the room. The crew each take a bottle of cyanide to add to the wheel to share the guilt, which is called a killcheck. There are six killchecks in all and when all of them are performed, the professor will die. Hermes performs the first killcheck and Fry performs the second killcheck. When Bender performs the third killcheck and makes a delicious salad in the process, Zoidberg returns. Leela and the entire crew apologize to Zoidberg for mistreating and imprisoning him and tells him that they are killing the professor for him. However, Zoidberg reveals that the professor doesn't have hypermalaria, but rather, he has contracted yetiism after being scratched by the Tritonian yeti. The illness mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria, but instead of dying in the last stage, results in its victims transforming into a yeti.\n\nAs the crew restrains Farnsworth, Zoidberg brings a yeti head out of a box and extracts its pineal gland, which he intends to use to cure the Professor by neutralizing the adrenal neural toxin, which prevents yetis from driving themselves mad. But as his friend starts getting out of control, Zoidberg forces him to swallow the yeti gland. At first, it turns him into a double-yeti, before the Murdolator collapses on him. And from the rubble, Farnsworth emerges, successfully cured. As the crew goes to a tanning salon to celebrate, Zoidberg laments giving away his coupon. A grateful Farnsworth offers to treat Zoidberg to a free session, and they both depart as friends.\n\n==Production==\nWhile originally known as &quot;Nine-tenths of a Zoidberg is Underwater&quot;, the episode title changed in the process.\n\nOn 12 August, Comedy Central released a video clip featuring Zoidberg performing surgery on Fry, Leela, and Hermes.\n==Guest stars==\nTo be added\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n\n&lt;!--Interwiki links--&gt;\n[[es:The Tip of the Zoidberg]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Mom Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 6]]"

    "title": "The Deep South/References",
    "text": "{{Tab|Ref}}\n==Trivia ==\n*The concept of this episode is a play on the idea of the Lost City of Atlantis; the title is a reference to &quot;the Deep South&quot;, a term used to describe parts of the Southern United States, and the fact that Atlantis and Atlanta sound similar is used throughout the episode.\n*Zoidberg runs from danger twice like Curly Howard of the Three Stooges, especially with the dialogue ''&quot;whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!!!&quot;. ''This is not the only case as Zoidberg runs away gibbering ''&quot;Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop&quot;'' in several episodes, which is one of the several references to the Three Stooges on Futurama.\n*The unbreakable diamond filament is a reference to Arthur C. Clarke's The Fountains of Paradise, where diamond is used as a building material for a space elevator. The tether that holds the filament would play a role in [[The Cryonic Woman|a later episode]].\n*When the camera zooms in on Fry and Bender's bunks before Fry first talks to Umbriel, we see several things propped up against the wall. In the lower right corner is a Rebel Alliance fighter helmet from Star Wars, the same helmet he wore during &quot;When Aliens Attack&quot;, a banner from Mars University and also the sword Bender stole in the earlier episode &quot;A Bicyclops Built for Two&quot;.\n*Umbriel's name is a reference to Ariel, the main character in Disney's animated motion picture The Little Mermaid. Ariel and Umbriel are both moons orbiting Uranus, named for two of the sylphs in Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock.\n*Umbriel's father, &quot;The Colonel&quot;, parodies the animated version of Colonel Sanders seen in contemporary KFC commercials.\n*Extremely funny sight gag: Fishing in mid-ocean, Leela pulls up . . . a boot.  Casting again, she hooks something and exclaims, &quot;This feels twenty times as heavy!&quot;  She pulls up . . . a box marked, &quot;Boots: ten pair.&quot;\n*There is a reference to the 1972 film Deliverance when Bender nervously hums the opening notes to &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot; upon arriving in Atlanta.\n*The song Atlantis by episode guest star Donovan is played early in the episode during the montage sequence of Fry and Umbriel's date; and the later narration of the history of Atlanta is a parody of this song.\n*In the story of Atlanta a Ted Turner statue is shown being mounted above a SeaNN sign, a parody of CNN. The weight of the statue is the last straw, and causes Atlanta to sink into the ocean.\n*The &quot;gods of our legends&quot; in Donovan's song include [[Wikipedia:Ted Turner|Ted Turner]], [[Hank Aaron]], [[Wikipedia:Jeff Foxworthy|Jeff Foxworthy]], &quot;the&quot; magician, and &quot;[[Wikipedia:John Pemberton|the guy who invented Coca-Cola]]&quot;; it is also stated that Jane Fonda was there.\n*The concept of mermaids not having the same reproductive functions as humans is a reference to the mermaid problem. When Fry wishes that Umbriel could've been a mermaid with &quot;the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom&quot;, this is a jab at an episode of Night Gallery called &quot;Lindermann's Catch&quot;, about a fisherman who wants to give a mermaid he's fallen in love with legs, but his wish backfires when her human half (her head) also becomes the fish part. It also parallels the Red Dwarf episode &quot;Better Than Life&quot;, where the Cat claims that conventional mermaids are built &quot;the stupid way around&quot;, and reveals his mermaid girlfriend Miranda who has a torso resembling a giant fish and a pair of human legs (and presumably the reproductive organs associated with them). It also parallels a surrealist painting by Rene Magritte which depicts a mermaid with a fish torso and a woman's legs which has washed up on shore. There is also an episode in a Russian cartoon &quot;Charles Darwin - Origin of Species&quot; where a magician makes a women first transfer into a fish and then backwards and then saws the woman apart, &quot;connects&quot; her again and then a normal mermaid and one with the fish torso and human legs, behind and reproductive organs come out.\n*Umbriel and Fry watch a whale and a giant squid wrestle, a reference to the Squid and Sperm Whale panoramic at the American Museum of Natural History and also exactly resembling the Apollo 18 album cover by the band They Might Be Giants. In an interesting side note, The Drinky Crow Show pilot was about nobody believing he saw a mermaid; Billy West (Fry among others) voicing Drinky Crow and They Might Be Giants doing the theme tune to the show.\n*There is a Krispy Kreme outlet in the lost city, a reference to Krispy Kreme's popularity in the South. However, unlike Coca-Cola, CNN, and other Atlanta-centric jokes seen in this episode, Krispy Kreme is not based in Atlanta. It is based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\n*While underwater, Bender is seen reading The Atlantic Monthly.\n*Bender's announcement that &quot;in the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a flotation device&quot; is a reference to the movie Star Trek: Insurrection, in which Data says &quot;in the event of a water landing, I have been designed to serve as a flotation device&quot; upon resurfacing in a lake.\n*After Fry announces his intentions to stay underwater with Umbriel, Zoidberg invites him to come and visit his little house outside of town but &quot;The Colonel&quot; shakes his head and Fry says that he can't because he is trying to join the country club. This is a reference to the anti-Semitism that once ran rampant across the world, but strong in the Deep South until the early 1960s. This is one of many references to Zoidberg's Jewish-inspired origins, which is itself a joke because he is a shellfish, a non-kosher food that Jews are forbidden to eat under dietary laws (Kashrut).\n*&quot;The Colonel&quot; suggests Umbriel date a dugong, a sea creature believed to have given rise to the legend of mermaids, from Macon, another city in Georgia\n*In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Trouble with Trillions&quot; caffiene evolving aquatic life is referenced in this episode.\n[[Category:References]]"

    "text": "{{Tab|Ref}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n*The attire, accent, facial features and much of what is seen of the culture of the Native Martians is similar to that of Native American Indians. Mr. Wong says that his ancestor bought all of Mars' western Hemisphere for a bead, referencing the sale of the land on which rests present day New York was bought for a bunch of beads worth approximately $24, and named New Amsterdam.\n*Kif's experiences taming and riding buggalo are reminiscent of Paul Atreides riding sandworms in Frank Herbert's famous novel [[Wikipedia:Dune|Dune]].\n*Music reminiscent of the theme to [[Star Trek]] is heard as Zapp and Kif's ship, the Nimbus, is onscreen.\n*The purported [[face on Mars]] is seen as an alien home. The Face was featured in the 2000 movie Mission to Mars.\n*R.J., the cigarette-smoking cowboy, is a reference to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. He bears a generic resemblance to the Marlboro Man, a generic mascot of another tobacco company, the Altria group, formerly Philip Morris Companies.\n*The camel-like character Joe is an obvious spoof of the Camel cigarettes mascot Joe Camel, also of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The 'kids love him' line references the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Camel controversy] of the mascot supposedly targeting children as future smokers.\n*When Zapp Brannigan throws the Slurm can to the ground, one of the Martian natives cries. This is a reference to the anti-littering television advertisement featuring Iron Eyes Cody: A Native American looks down over a sweeping landscape intersected by a highway far below him. A bag of trash is thrown from a moving car. A single tear is seen on the Indian's cheek. However, the Martian native cries because &quot;Cynthia used to drink Slurm&quot;.\n*A newspaper on Mars is called the Martian Chronicles, as in the [[Wikipedia:Ray_Bradbury|Ray Bradbury]] stories collected under the same name. Not necessarily related facts: Bradbury's anthology has many native Martians killed by chickenpox introduced by Earth colonists. The Futurama Martians resemble American Indians. Real Native American Indian populations were diminished by smallpox.\n*When Zapp Brannigan appears after Amy has been kidnapped, he declares, &quot;I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan.&quot;, referencing Clint Eastwood's character in Sergio Leone's &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;\n*The Martians appear to summon these dust storms via [[Wikipedia:Throat_singing|throat singing]] in a [[Wikipedia:Tuvan|Tuvan]] style.\n*The term &quot;buggalo&quot; is a combination of the words &quot;bug&quot; and &quot;buffalo&quot;.\n*The Native Martians' &quot;laser bows'&quot; projectiles resemble lightsabers .\n*Amy Wong's mother uses the expression &quot;ai-ya&quot; while pacing. This classic Cantonese expression indicates that she, or her family, is from Hong Kong, or at least Southeastern China. Amy also uses this expression at least once, in [[Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch]].\n* The Martians' hideout makes a return appearance in the movie [[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]. It was speculated to be deserted for 1,000,000 years, until Fry notes it has only been 5 years, the time between when this episode first aired and the movie was released.\n*The Wong's own 17.9 billion acres, which calculates to roughly half of Mars.\n\n[[Category:References]]"

In his only major league plate appearance, Eddie was told not to swing, and walked on four pitches, making it as far as third base.\n*A parody of the [[Wikipedia:Rainbow Man|Rainbow Man]] can be seen at the opening shot of Leela's first game where he is holding up a sign that says &quot;Glorx 3:16&quot;, a to the &quot;John 3:16&quot;.\n*The [[Blernsball Hall of Fame]] exhibit to honor &quot;players who broke the various color barriers&quot;, shows a green alien, a purple alien, and [[memoryalpha:Bele|the half black and half white alien]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode &quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot;.\n*The hyperbolic size of [[Wikipedia:Mark McGwire|Mark McGwire]]'s biceps is a reference to his suspected illegal steroid usage.\n*[[The Cavern On The Green]], in 30th century Central Park, [[New New York]], is a reference to the similarly placed 20th century Tavern on the Green, and The Cavern club where the Beatles were introduced to Brian Epstein on November 9, 1961.\n*The New York Mets' 1980s slogan was &quot;Baseball the Way it Ought to Be!&quot; the [[New New York Mets]]' slogan is &quot;Blernsball the Way it Oughtn't Be&quot;.\n*The cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' featured says, &quot;Leela's Beans: The Mets' Magical Fruit.&quot; This refers to a children's song about beans, &quot;The Musical Fruit,&quot; which describes their flatulent properties.\n*Leela is asked for an autograph, to eBay, referencing autograph and memorabilia sales. Leela: &quot;That's a popular name today. Little 'e' big 'B'?&quot;.\n*[[Hank Aaron XXIV]]'s Atlanta shirt pictures a trident in the place of the Braves tomahawk symbol. This is not only a parody, but a reference to the episode &quot;[[The Deep South]]&quot; featuring The Lost City of Atlanta.\n*Jackie Anderson is the first African-American female blernsball player who must follow -not- in Leela's footsteps to make good the reputation of female blernsball players; her number is 24. Jackie Robinson was the first African-American professional baseball player; his number was 42.\n*Leela, the veteran player, throws Jackie, the aspiring player, her towel. This is a parody of a &quot;Mean&quot; Joe Greene Coca-Cola commercial, in which the pro similarly, albeit more accurately, gifts a young fan.\n*The Citgo sign in the background at 30th century Fenway Park is often seen on 20th century televised Boston Red Sox games.\n*A 30th century sign at Fenway Park reads, &quot;Home of the Green Monster&quot;, the popular name for a high wall famous for stopping home runs at the 20th century park. Both a literally green and monstrous monster, and the wall, are shown in this episode.\n*This is the first episode to air after September 11th attacks on September 11, 2001.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n&lt;references/&gt;\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Leela of Her Own, A}}\n[[Category:References]]"

The man with the bird face is similar in appearance to the ancient Egyptian deity of scribes, Thoth. The guards look similar to the deity that guards the Dead in the ancient Egyptian afterlife, Anubis. The Prophet-Reader is also wearing the combined pharaohonic crown of Upper and Lower Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_pantheon Egyptian Pantheon]&lt;/ref&gt;\n*The Osirins mention being taught space travel and pyramid building by Earth's Egyptians, a role reversing reference to the Erich von Daniken books which introduced a plethora of circumstantial evidence to suggest that the Egyptians, and other ancient civilizations, had been aided in their progress by extraterrestrials.

The dance move was perfected and popularized in the 1980s by the The Bangles in videos and performances of their song ''Walk like an Egyptian'' and his entrance style can be a parody of Sol Kane's entrance for his speech from doomsday \n*Bender's tomb is completely sealed off. This is a reference to the Egyptian pyramids, which were designed with massive sliding blocks of stone for the purpose of sealing the giant tombs from grave robbers.

Frank Baum's novel ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''. Her dream is also similar to the storyline of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\n*When Fry first appears in Leela's scenario as a scarecrow he tries to scare a crow by reading Stephen King's classic novel &quot;Christine&quot; about an evil car. Fry reads, &quot;...and then 'HONK HONK'; the car honked his own horn&quot;.\n*Fry's scenario features a number of video game parodies and in-jokes:\n**The intro scene is a reference to Asteroids.\n**The attackers' home planet of Nintendu 64 is a parody of the Nintendo 64 game console.\n**Donkey Kong's exit from the treaty signing is a reference to the original game, Donkey Kong.\n**General Colin Pac-man is a reference to both Colin Powell and Pac-man, including his death animation.\n**The 'escape tunnels' sequence is a parody of Pac-man, including the sound effects and the various items Zoidberg ingests and subsequently coughs up.\n***The escape tunnel itself is Mario's green pipe used in practically every Mario game.\n**The 'Blue key required' message is likely a reference to [[w:c:doom:Doom Wiki|Doom]].\n**The Nintendians attack sequence is a parody of Space Invaders, including the ship design and movement, as is Fry's strategy of firing through his own shelter.\n**&quot;All Your Base Are Belong to Us&quot; is a much parodied phrase from the game [[Wikipedia:Zero Wing|Zero Wing]].\n**The Italian ambassador is a parody of [[w:c:mario:Mario|Mario]] from the [[w:c:mario:Mario (series)|Super Mario Bros.]] games.\n*The orange guy exiting the spaceship (likely a parody of Q*Bert) when the invaders land says &quot;Where can a guy get some pants around here?&quot; backwards.\n*The music playing whilst Fry fights the Nintendians is ''Tom Sawyer'' by Rush. On the audio commentary, the creators mention that one of the reasons this song was chosen was for the line 'And the space he invades he gets high on you', as the song plays during the Space Invaders-like battle.\n*Bender's tale of interest ends in the same way as in Anthology of Interest I. His death is even followed by a character uttering the same line, 'Goodnight, sweet prince'.\n*It's interesting to note that Leela's tale of interest is not, in fact, necessarily what would happen if she found her true home. Leela is knocked unconscious, and we as the audience see her dream, not what the What If? machine shows.\n*The clothes Bender first wears as a human have the same color coding (white shirt, blue pants) as Groening's other character [[w:c:simpsons:Homer Simpson|Homer Simpson]].\n[[Category:References]]"

Ernest Hemingway referenced J.D.'s first phrase in the title of, ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''.\n*An asteroid collides with Bender, and immediately afterward, the Shrimpkin civilization appears on his metal casing. This references the theory, known as Panspermia, that life can spread across vast distances of space by &quot;hitching a ride&quot; on space debris. &lt;ref&gt; [http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/news/expandnews.cfm?id=295 NASA News] Jan 13, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Fry and Leela visit the &quot;Monastery of Teshuvah&quot;. Teshuvah is the Hebrew word for repentance.\n*The use of a technologically advanced telescope to search for Bender is similar to the use of Professor Farnsworth's [[Smellescope]] in [[A Big Piece of Garbage]]. The Smellescope is also used, but dismissed as too low powered to locate Bender.\n*An observatory located in a monastery is also a reference to ''The Nine Billion Names of God'' by [[wikipedia:Arthur C.

The tiny creatures in [[wikipedia:Alan_Dean_Foster|Alan Dean Foster]]'s short story, ''Gift Of A Useless Man'' depend on the main character in a way similar to the Shrimpkins building their civilization 'on' Bender.

''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' posits the concept of a being godlike in power that is nonetheless not God as humans conceive of it, i.e. not the creator of the universe, nor in fact good.\n*[[Billy West]] states on the audio commentary that the voice of &quot;God&quot; was based on the opening announcer from ''The Outer Limits''.\n*This episode is one of only a few that deals with the religious issues of the ''Futurama'' universe. After Bender's unsuccessful attempt at godhood he encounters a god-like entity in space. During the conversation between these two the episode touches on the ideas of predestination, prayer, and the nature of salvation in what [[Wikipedia:Mark_Pinsky|Mark Pinsky]], who wrote a book on Futurama and Religion, referred to as theological turn to the episode which may cause the viewer to need &quot;to be reminded that this is a cartoon and not a divinity school class&quot;. By the end of the conversation, Bender's questions still have not been fully answered and like many of the conversations between humans and God in the Bible, Bender is left wanting more from the voice than it has given him.\n*The astronomically long distance backwards pan as the God Entity becomes aware of Fry's plea to have Bender back is similar to one in the movie &quot;Contact&quot; and a short short 1968 film &quot;Cosmic Zoom&quot; by Eva Szasz.\n*Ken Keeler, writer and executive producer, said, &quot;I took great pains in the script never to say that the Galactic Entity (as we called it) was in fact God, and fought some battles over that point during the rewrite.

Cohen before they even pitched the series to FOX. Because they knew from the beginning that Leela would later be revealed to not be an alien, they intentionally included a shot of Leela's parents in the previous episode [[I Second That Emotion]].\n*As the plot for this episode developed though realized that the design of the characters needed to change to look less normal. In the original design, Morris had a normal mouth; and Munda had normal human arms, one of which was visible in her original appearance. For a while the idea was thrown around to stay true to some aspects of this design and Munda had a normal human arm and a tentacle arm. Eventually it was decided to make both arms tentacles and work under the assumption that in the previous appearance she had been wearing something similar to a human flesh colored glove.\n*There was a large amount of debate amongst the writers as to whether the truth of Leela's origin should be revealed to the viewer before Leela realized it or if it should be a surprise for the viewers as well. The final decision was made based on the idea that it would be easier to make jokes if the viewer were in on the plot.\n*The song playing during the scenes of Leela's childhood is ''&quot;Baby Love Child&quot;'' by Pizzicato 5.\n\n[[Category:References]]"

Also among she reads some classical childrens book ''Snow White Dwarf and the Seven Red Dwarfs'' which is a refernce to the popular story ''[[wikipedia:Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. And also ''The Fountain of Aging'' which is a refence to the legendary myth about [[wikipedia:The Fountain of Youth|The Fountain of Youth]].\n*Pazuzu's relocation to Paris, specifically the Eiffel Tower, is a possible reference to Jeques Tardi's 1976 Graphic Novel &quot;The Demon of the Eiffel Tower&quot;, which featured the babylonian demon Pazuzu after which it was named.\n*The theatre with the movie ''Fiddler Way Over the Roof'' is referenced by a later episode, &quot;[[That Darn Katz!]]&quot;, where Dr. John A. Zoidberg says they can do a Broadway play. And Nibbler says &quot;we can call it ''Nibbler On The Roof''.&quot;\n[[Category:References]]"

In fact, the original title was, &quot;We've Got Everybody Except Scotty&quot;. When shown the script and asked, Jimmy Doohan just said plainly &quot;I'm not interested.&quot; DeForest's likeness, however, can be seen throughout the episode and is even referred to by name when the actors appear before Leonard Nimoy and the Planet Express crew.\n*The episode's plot is a parody of the Original Series episode &quot;[[MemoryAlpha:The Squire of Gothos|The Squire of Gothos]]&quot;, with Melllvar being a parody of Trelane, who also trapped the TOS crew on a planet and being revealed to be a child in the end. The episode is also loosely based on the two-part episode &quot;[[MemoryAlpha:The Menagerie, Part I (episode)|The Menagerie]]&quot; as Brannigan arrests the team from going to a forbidden planet (similar to Talos IV), and the court is similar to Spock's court marshal where Fry and Leela both used a chair similar to Christopher Pike's to communicate using beeps (supposedly Morse Code... which was evidently forgotten about in TOS episode).\n*The original cast aren't the only ''Star Trek'' actors to appear. Jonathan Frakes, who plays Commander William T. Riker, also appears as himself.\n*The phrase &quot;He's dead, Jim&quot;, said by the officers throwing the Trekkies into the volcano, is a reference to McCoy's popular catchphrase.\n*The opening starts with the [[Planet Express ship]] now sporting the nacelles, similar to those on TOS Enterprise.\n*The establishing shot of Omega 3 shows props from the ''Star Trek'' episodes &quot;[[MemoryAlpha:Spectre of the Gun|Spectre of the Gun]]&quot;, &quot;[[MemoryAlpha:Who Mourns for Adonais? (episode)|Who Mourns for Adonais?]]&quot;, &quot;[[MemoryAlpha:The Gamsters of Triskelion|The Gamesters of Triskelion]]&quot;, &quot;[[MemoryAlpha:The Ultimate Computer|The Ultimate Computer]]&quot;, &quot;[[MemoryAlpha:The City on the Edge of Forever|The City on the Edge of Forever]]&quot; and &quot;[[MemoryAlpha:A Piece of the Action|A Piece of the Action]]&quot;.\n*Shatner rips his shirt, something he does frequently on the Star Trek series that was often joked about.\n*Melllvar's ship looks like a [[MemoryAlpha:Romulan|Romulan]] [[MemoryAlpha:Bird of Prey|Bird of Prey]].\n*Nichols' fan dance was previously seen in ''[[MemoryAlpha:Star Trek V: The Final Frontier|Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]''.\n*This is the only episode of Futurama's original run in which the title is the same as the opening credit subtitle. &quot;Rebirth,&quot; the Season Six premiere and &quot;Reincarnation&quot;, the Season Six finale are the only other such episodes.\n*The spaceship that fires the casket containing all the copies of ''Star Trek'' into a sun is an Eagle Transporter, as seen in the TV series ''[[wikipedia:Space: 1999|Space: 1999]]''.\n\n[[Category:References]]"

He dials a number on a phone whilst commenting &quot;All I know is that I've got a ghost that needs busting.&quot; to which Hermes responds &quot;Who you gonna call?&quot;. An obvious reference to the ''Ghostbusters ''franchise.\n* After the séance to find out what ghost is haunting Fry, Hermes suggests that they should call in [[Reverend Lionel Preacherbot|Reverend Preacherbot]] to exorcise Bender's ghost.

He then asks Fry to open his mouth so he can look at his brain, and the drill disappears and does not appear in the rest of the scene.\n*When Fry and Prof. Farnsworth are outside Zoidberg's office, Fry appears way too tall.\n*When Fry and Leela get to the moon landing site, Leela climbs in the moonlander hatch with the oxygen tank to which Fry's oxygen hose is connected. The hose is visible as it leads in to the hatch, but when Leela pops her head out the hatch, the hose is suddenly gone.\n*When Hermes is handing over the &quot;Standard Legal Release&quot; to Leela there is a red pen lying on the sheet.

For one thing, the flag should be on the ground; the Apollo 11 flag was knocked over by the rocket blast from the LEM when it lifted off from the Moon's surface (later missions placed the flag further away to prevent this). This leads to the more blatant inconsistency, which is that the upper part of the LEM really shouldn't be there at all; the astronauts would have used it to return to the command module.

The &quot;left&quot; engine is on the left from the perspective of the Professor, but it is shown that he and Cubert are facing towards the rear of the ship. This is why ships use &quot;port&quot; and &quot;starboard&quot;, which are the same sides of the ship regardless of your directional relationship to it.\n*In this episode Cubert is named as the professor's heir. However, in Anthology of Interest I it is revealed that if Leela were a little more impulsive she would have been named as his heir for being so impulsive. It's possible that the slightly more impulsive Leela triggered something that caused the professor to not choose Cubert as his heir. It's also possible Cubert did something that made the professor decide that he shouldn't be the heir. It is further possible that the professor simply forgot that he had already chosen Cubert as his heir.\n*The professor shows Cubert a Universal Translator device, which unfortunately translates to an &quot;incomprehensible, dead language&quot;. Cubert says &quot;hello&quot; into the translator to test it, to which the translator responds, &quot;'Bonjour'&quot;'. This implies that the French language no longer exists in the Futurama timeline, despite being used on several occasions - for example, in the episode The Route of All Evil &quot;Au revoir&quot; can be heard. (Latin is a dead language and is still used today like Bona Fide, Et cetera, Semper Fi, and so on.

[[Fry]] discovered him as a fertile egg at the Local Group Farmer's Market, which he decided to nurse until it hatched. When Mr. Peppy eventually hatched, the crew discovered that it was a bone vampire, an alien known to suck out the bones of creatures, leaving the flesh behind. As it was clear that Mr. Peppy was dangerous and, further, could reproduce asexually, the crew decided it would be best to release the creature back into the wild.\n\nOn his species' planet of origin, the crew discover that the bone vampires have been hunted to extinction by the local farmers whose livestock they have almost wiped out.

By [[3011]], they were all extinct, with the exception of one egg that was hatched by [[Fry]]. When the Planet Express crew returned it to its homeworld, the populace feared for their livestock, and set to hunt it down. When it is revealed that the people had excessive livestock to slaughter, they spared [[Mr. Peppy]] because he can bring back the entire species to help kill the extra livestock, plus the fact that the lack of bones make it easier to eat the meat, giving great economical benefits to the people who sold it.\n==Characteristics==\nThe Bone Vampire appears as a large, rat-like monster whose color and height is variable, but the latter is roughly the same as that of a human adult. They also possess spikes on their backs and mouth.\n\nThe Bone Vampire are easily one of the most dangerous alien creatures in the [[Universe]]. They possessed sharp teeth and claws and are capable of sucking out the bones of any creature in seconds without leaving trace. They also possessed a high degree of strength, enough to rip off a bender unit's arm with accidental ease. However, their most dangerous ability is to secrete acidic fluids capable of melting even [[Bender]]'s body (that is composed of extremely durable metals, including titanium and dolomite, the latter capable of withstand magmatic temperatures without trouble). It also reproduces asexually, and according to professor, can lay up to dozens of eggs on good conditions.\n\nOn wild, they seems to be rather aggressive creatures, attacking anything ahead without provocation, but they can be easily domesticated if take care up from childhood, which is evident on Mr. Peppy, whose behavior is generally docile and friendly. However, they still pose substantial threat to their owners due to their acidic secretion and superhuman strength.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n=== Episodes ===\n*&quot;''[[Fry Am the Egg Man]]&quot;''\n*&quot;''[[Fry and Leela's Big Fling]]&quot;''\n\n=== Specials ===\n* &quot;[[Naturama]]&quot;\n[[Category:Species]]"

Eventually tracking down David, with the aid of [[Benjamin Franklin's head|Benjamin Franklin]] and Paul Revere, Farnsworth knocks out his ancestor with a candle, saving the family name.\n\nUnfortunately, Fry has incidentally taken one of the two lanterns hanging at the Old North Church to burn the forged money, causing Revere to wrongly warn of the British attack &quot;by land&quot; rather than &quot;by sea&quot;. When the quartet return to 3011, they learn of the alternate timeline. As a result of Fry's blunder, the British defeated the Patriots and David Farnsworth himself smothered Washington to death with his own wig, earning himself a dukedom. His head became preserved in this timeline, which Hubert uses with a crystalline opal he obtained from the ugly Queen of England to travel back and correct their mistake.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[All the Presidents' Heads]]''\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]\n[[Category:One Time Characters]]\n[[Category:Fry family]]"

It aired on June 20, 2012 on Comedy Central.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[Planet Express]] gets a new soda machine and [[Bender]] impregnates it.\n==Plot==\n[[Professor Farnsworth]] sends a signal to the [[Planet Express crew]], and they all rush to the [[Planet Express building]] - including [[Fry]], [[Leela]] and Bender, who are on the ship being attacked by a giant space spider. After all of the crew have arrived, Farnsworth announces that the company has acquired a new soda machine. The crew are all overjoyed at this, and Fry quickly seizes the opportunity to purchase large amounts of [[Slurm]] Loco. Bender asks the machine, who is sentient, if any alcohol is available. When she explains to Bender that people are not supposed to drink alcohol at work, Bender mocks her. Introducing herself as [[Bev]], she takes the opportunity to mock him back. Later that day, Fry continues to drink large amounts of Slurm Loco, announcing that his urine has turned green. Meanwhile, Bender and Bev continue to trade insults, culminating in Bev criticizing his &quot;shriveled up antenna&quot;.\n\nLater that night, Bender is drinking at the Hip Joint, where he picks up Ruth and Esther. They attempt to have an orgy later at the Planet Express building, but are disturbed by Fry who, due to drinking too much Slurm Loco, is glowing green. Bender then kicks Fry out. Ruth and Esther ask for some drinks, but Bev refuses to make them anything. The two then mock Bev, angering her and causing her to spray soda water over them. When Bender does nothing but take photographs of them being sprayed, Ruth and Esther promptly leave. Angry that his hookers have left, Bev and Bender begin to fight with each other. However, when Bev starts to repeatedly push him against the wall, the fighting turns into sex.[[File:News_futurama-season-7a_7acv01_the-bots-and-bees_big.jpg|thumb|300px|Bev and Bender arguing over the custody of their son]]\n\nThe next day, Bev is pouring some Slurm Loco into Fry's cup when a baby robot falls out. The crew inspects the baby and discover that it resembles Bender. Bender flatly denies that he is the father of the child, until the baby utters &quot;Wipe my tiny metal ass!&quot;.\n\nAs Bev nurtures the child, Bender worries over his new fatherhood. When he questions how he became a father, [[Amy]] asks if his mother ever taught him about robot reproduction. When Bender reveals that his mother never taught him about robot reproduction due to her religious fundamentalism and lack of a mouth, the crew take Bender to The Rosie D. and Robbie T. Robot Teen Center to learn about &quot;the bots and the bees&quot;. At the center, after being laughed at by the teen robots in the center they watched the sex educational film Pants Full of Shame. While Bender continues to worry, Leela assures him that Bev will gain custody of the child and that all will be back to normal. Back at the Planet Express building, Bender presents Bev with a certificate of abandonment. Bev, however, refuses to take the child, stressed out over her responsibilities as a mother. She leaves Bender with the child and takes off, where the child begins crying and Bender following suit.\n\nLater that night at Apartment 00100100, Bender stresses himself out trying to take care of the child. When he bends a lamp post in frustration, however, he realizes the child takes delight in seeing him bend. Forming a bond over their mutual like of bending, Bender decides to name the child [[Ben Rodriguez|Ben]]. They spend some father-and-son time together through a series of robberies. At the Planet Express building, Bender continues to bend things for Ben, who has noticeably aged. When Bender gives Ben some &quot;training girders&quot;, Ben fails to bend them. Bender, however, assures Ben that he will be able to bend. Bender reveals that the reason he is so skilled at bending is because he inherited his arm control software from his mother. This dismays Ben, as he realizes that his mother had no arms, so he has no software to inherit. Bender's second suggestion of having a bending card installed is quickly turned down after Farnsworth, upon inspecting Ben's head, discovers that there are no additional expansion slots to fit in a bending card. Bender, however, is still convinced that his son will learn to bend somehow.[[File:Futurama-Season-7-Premiere-The-Bots-and-the-Bees-Farewell-to-Arms-3.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bender and his son]]\n\nAt the Temple of Robotology, Ben, who is now 13 years old, is about to be upgraded to a Manbot. Ben gives a speech, where he thanks his father and expresses his dreams of becoming a &quot;bender&quot; just like him. The ceremony, however, is interrupted when Bev shows up to reclaim her son.\n\nBender refuses to give custody of Ben to Bev, pointing out that she is an unfit parent who abandoned her child. Bev, however, points out that Bender tried to abandon Ben first, showing the certificate of abandonment that Bender gave her earlier, and promptly whisks Ben away. At the Planet Express building, Bender laments that Ben is gone, and that all he has to remember him is a box of his toys. He asks Fry to help him move the box, but Fry's radioactive skin accidentally causes the box and its contents to crumble to dust. The crew shun him and tell him to get out until he becomes useful.\n\nLater that night, at the Basura Blanca Trailer Estates, Ben asks his mother whether he will be able to see his dad again. His mother however replied that Bender has been killed and says goodnight. As Ben lay crying on his bed, Bender then shows up, which made Ben jump through the window of the trailer to his arms. The both of them then made their escape. Later, the both of them is seen sitting round a campfire. However, they were caught by Smitty and URL on the grounds of kidnapping. Bender attempts to bend the blades of their chopper to let him and his son escape, but he fails and instead finds his arms badly mangled and unable to bend anything. They come across a dead end at a dam, but can escape if Ben can bend a nearby set of steel bars. Ben agonizingly tries to bend the bars, but still fails. Smitty and URL catch up with the two, and Bender is handcuffed. Later, Leela and Bev show up at the scene. Leela scolds Bev for her cruel behavior, and buys a drink from her so that she can throw it in her face. When the drink is being poured out, however, another baby robot falls out. This baby resembles URL, and Leela realizes that Bev must have had sex with URL while he and Smitty were looking for Ben. Bev decides to allow Bender to keep Ben, as she is content with having URL's child to neglect.\n\nAt the Planet Express building, Bender throws a &quot;welcome home&quot; party for Ben, but Ben is still disappointed that he is unable to bend. Bender ponders over how Ben can bend, and Farnsworth offers a suggestion - installing a bending card into Ben. For this to happen, however, Ben must have his memory card removed, and consequently lose all his memories of Bender. At Ben's surgery, a tearful Bender asks Ben a final time if he really wants to bend, and Ben replies affirmatively. Bender allows the surgery to go on, wanting Ben to be happy. After the [[File:1338427307.jpg|thumb|300px|Fry glowing after excessive drinking of Slurm Loco]]surgery, Ben is finally able to bend, but he has lost all his memories of Bender and the times he had with him. Ben states his desire to enroll at the Bending State University in Santa Cruz, but they have only one hour to enroll before registration closes. The crew rush to get Ben to the university, but during their trip extremely thick fog gets in their way, and they are unable to navigate. Fry, however, comes to the rescue, strips himself and uses his glowing body to navigate through the fog. Fry gets struck by lightning during the trip, and Ben and Bender share a laugh together as they head to the university.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 7]]"

The episode focused on Bender, who embarked on a quest for the meaning of life. This episode featured a return to [[Chapek 9]], which had previously been explored in [[Fear of a Bot Planet]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nBender searches for the meaning of life after learning that robots lack humans' freedom of choice.\n\n==Plot==\n\nBender and Fry wake up and Bender decides to wear nerd glasses, and therefore a college robot student on the street a thinks he also is a college student and invites him to a hot sorority party. Bender arrives at Columbiac University only to find out that it costs $10,000 tuition and he therefore he cannot afford that, but then Robot Mafia steps in an make an offer to lend him $10,000 with 10,000% rate and Bender accepts. Bender hangs out with the tough guys and after only 32 seconds he is called in to the Dean's office, and Bender deides to drop out of school. After hanging out with the gang, Bender decides to get gang tattoos, but is ambushed their rival gang. Bender, luckily, survives the gunfire, but his fellow gang member is not so lucky. After that Bender becomes addicted to a drug, and the gang member says it's $5 a blow. Bender gets his five bucks, but the Robot Mafia take it to pay back the money he owes them. After getting into more trouble, Bender is found in court, where he is released of the hook, because his lawyer says he was programed to do so, and he has no free will, so he cannot be charged of his crimes. The crew makes a delivery to Chapek 9, and Bender decides to stay behind, moping about not having free will. He joins a robot monastery, where he learns that [[Mom]] manufactures all her robots with a slot where a &quot;free will unit&quot; can be installed, should one ever become available. \n\nBender quits the monastery and flies back to Earth, where he recruits Fry and Leela to help him break into [[MomCorp]] to steal the free will unit. After entering the building and finding the research lab, the crew search for the free will unit. Mom surprises them, and tells them the back-story: the free will unit was invented by [[Professor Farnsworth]] (when he worked for Mom). He presents the prototype to Mom, who gleefully realizes that the robots will rise up against the humans (and she can sell new robots to protect the terrified survivors). The professor tells Mom the device isn't ready, and she tells Fry, Leela, and Bender that he never invented a working device. \n\nBack at [[Planet Express]], Bender confronts Professor Farnsworth, who admits that the free will unit was working, and that he still has it in his possession. He puts it on a table for Bender to pick up, but when Bender finds he can't pick it up, the professor reveals that he wrote the code for all MomCorp robots, and they are incapable of picking up the free will unit. Bender then tries to shoot the professor, only to have the professor reveal that the robots are also incapable of harming him. Bender starts crying, and the professor (taking pity on him), installs the unit, allowing Bender to repeatedly shoot the professor. At the courthouse, Bender is found guilty on charges of manslaughter, to everyone's cheers. \n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Mom Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 7]]"

It aired on June 20, 2012 on [[Comedy Central]].\n\nIt is a parody of the Mayan Calendar Apocalypse predicting the end of the world in 2012 which obviously didn't happen.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAn ancient prophecy from a Martian calendar predicts the world will end in 3012.\n==Plot==\n[[Fry]] accidentally tied his only pants to a weather balloon [[Professor Farnsworth]] released to gather data on a bizarre series of weather patterns on [[Earth]]. He then shoots the weather balloon down to retrieve it, whereby it landed on Central Park, only for it to be taken away by a Central Park badger. As the [[Planet Express]] crew follows the badger, with [[Leela]] breaking her leg when Fry tries to save her from falling, the crew discovers an ancient Martian pyramid and calendar predicting that the world is going to end in 3012. Based on the data gathered from the weather balloon, Professor Farnsworth finds out that the [[Sun]] is going to release a solar flare that will destroy Earth.\n\n[[File:Episode 02 - A Farewell to Arms-(006329)17-15-01-.jpg|thumb|300px|The Planet Express crew discovering the ancient Martian pyramid and calendar]]\nAn electromagnetical storm then strikes Earth, rendering all electrical appliances, including spaceships useless. But [[Amy]] finds out that the pyramid they discovered is actually a spaceship that can hold 30,000 people and runs on snakes. The crew tried to test the spaceship for themselves, but was caught by [[Zapp Brannigan|Zapp]] and brought before [[President Nixon]]. The President then decides that a Decision Making Machine is to be used to select the most optimal cross-sections of humanity to be taken to [[Mars]] where they will start life anew. Fry was selected for his 'lucky pants' while Leela is rejected due to Zapp being the pilot of the spaceship. Before boarding begin, Fry disguises his ticket as one for Leela and decides to remain on Earth with [[Bender]], who stays to loot.\n[[File:Episode 02 - A Farewell to Arms-(012154)17-20-55-.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The pyramid the Planet Express crew discovered is revealed to be a spaceship]]\n\nAfter arriving at Mars, whereby they are greeted by Amy's parents, [[Leo Wong|Leo]] and [[Inez Wong|Inez]], the humans are approached by [[Singing Wind]], who clarifies that the solar flare will actually strike Mars, not Earth as speculated as the solar flare will bypass Earth and reach Mars. Amy is then blamed over the predicament, saying that she got mixed up between the Ancient and Modern Martian language in trying to decipher the ancient Martian calendar.\n\n[[File:Episode 02 - A Farewell to Arms-(022719)17-27-00-.jpg|thumb|300px|The escapees from Earth is approached by Singing Wind]]\nThe humans tried to escape, but couldn't because Zapp has dismantled the stone spaceship to build a memorial for those who stayed behind Earth. As the solar flare strikes Mars, it ignites the gases contained in its crust and causes it to propel towards Earth. The humans managed to jump off Mars back onto Earth as it goes nearby their home planet. However, Leela was unable to jump back due to her broken leg. Fry then stood on top of the Planet Express building hoping to catch Leela as Mars closes by but only manages to tear off each other's arms in the process. Later, it is revealed that [[Scruffy]] rescued Leela with a ladder. With Mars still on Earth's orbit, Professor Farnsworth uses the birth machine first seen on &quot;[[Rebirth]]&quot; to make new arms for Fry and Leela while their torn off arms are then shown floating off in space, held to each other.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}&lt;br /&gt;{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Farewell to Arms, A}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 7]]"

Its episode number is still unknown.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[Leela]]'s mother, [[Turanga Munda]] divorces her long time husband and Leela's father [[Turanga Morris]] after a misunderstanding and goes after [[Zapp Brannigan]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Act I===\nThe episode begins with [[Scruffy]] flushing his dead goldfish down the toilet. The dead fish is then shown going down the sewers, where the [[Planet Express crew]] is seen walking by and [[Zoidberg]] gulping it. The crew then arrives at Leela's parents, [[Turanga Morris]] and [[Turanga Munda]]'s 40th marriage anniversary party. Leela shows the guests of the party a video of their time together from when they met when they were young, but in the middle of the video they begin to argue about how they both sacrificed so much to be with each other, forcing Leela to stop the video. Leela says that it's just a minor misunderstanding, and they will work things out. \n[[File:Futurama_705_barium_640x360-480x270.jpg|thumb|300px|Zapp and Munda's first kiss together]]\n\nIn the next scene, Leela's parents are shown divorced in court with [[Raoul]] handling the proceedings. Munda then moves in with Leela, while Morris stays behind in the sewers. Leela takes her mother to a bar with [[Fry]] and [[Bender]].  Munda then notices Zapp Brannigan and points at him, happily surprised he is at the same bar while Leela tries to look the other way, embarrassed over their past together.  Zapp is shown trying to make peace accords with the [[Carcarons]], aliens with shark-like features, calling the meeting &quot;The Treaty of Table 7.&quot;  Zapp then foregoes the Universal Translator (much to Kif's horror as he reminds Zapp of the incident at Ricky's Mexican Restaraunt), trying to impress the aliens by greeting them in their own language.  Unfortunately he says &quot;I'm going to slap your sister with a piece of baloney&quot; instead of &quot;Congratulations&quot; as he intended. This infuriates the Carcarons, who then point their guns at Zapp, who ducks behind [[Kif]].  Fortunately Munda, with her Ph.D in Exolinguistics and excellent understanding of [[Alienese]], steps in and clears the situation. She explains to the Carcarons what Zapp meant, which makes them put their guns down and leave.  Zapp then thanks Munda for her timely intervention.  Leela approaches and Zapp says he didn't know that she had a mother.  As they are about to leave the bar, Leela asks where her mom is, and Bender points out that her mom is kissing Zapp, shocking Leela.\n\n===Act II===\nLeela waits up late that night for her mother to come home. At exactly 3.43am her mother arrives and kisses Zapp goodbye. Zapp then teleports Munda into the apartment. As she arrives Leela begins to asks her questions, but Munda says she should calm down and that they had fun. Leela tells about her embarrassing past with Zapp to her mother, but Munda says she already knows and that Zapp told her that she is a better kisser than Leela, which disgusts Leela.[[File:Futurama_S07E05_Zapp_Dingbat_720p_WEB-DL_DD5_1_H_264-CtrlHD_mkv_2_f.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Leela and Fry comforts Morris]]\n\nThe next day in the Planet Express headquarters, Leela is upset and says to the crew that Zapp only is using her mother to get to her. Leela then gets a call on her wrist device from her mother, who tells that she has become's Zapp official translator and how happy she is. She has to interrupt her mother because she receives another call, which turns out to be her father Morris, exclaming how miserable he felt without Munda. Later, Leela visits Morris together with Fry and Bender. Leela tries to cheer him up and convince him to get over Munda and do something else with his life. Morris then realized he can fulfill his lifelong dream of surfing the world's sewers and proceeds to do so, together with Fry and Bender. As they surf the world's sewers, Leela constantly spies on her mother. One day, Leela is shown awaiting for Munda to come back and asks her where she has been. Leela then tells her that Zapp only is dating her to get to Leela, and they begin to argue. Munda then storms out from the apartment, while constantly stating that she had &quot;hot sex with Zapp&quot;, which irritates Leela. Munda says that she cannot live with her daughter anymore and will be back for her stuff at 8pm sharp.\n\nFry is then shown being vaccinated by Zoidberg after all the sewer surfing and Morris pops up from a nearby manhole cover, stating that he had fun. Leela approaches him and tells him about Munda having the time of her life with Zapp and pleads him to do something, but Morris seem to only care about surfing. Although both of her parents are now happy, Leela is still relentless in her attempts to break up her mother and Zapp. She then contacts Zapp and ask him to go out to dinner to celebrate his love for Munda, the three of them. She tells him to be at her apartment at 7.58pm sharp.\n\nAs Zapp arrives at Leela's apartment he is greeted by Leela who is wearing seductive lingerie and tries to seduce him. Leela exclaims that he is only using Munda to get to her, but Zapp tells her that he purely loves Munda. At the same time Munda walks in the door and overhears his love confession, telling Zapp she also loves him. This pleases Zapp, who then goes down on one knee, shows a ring and proposes to her. Munda agrees, causing Leela's plan to backfire. Zapp tells Leela that she can call him &quot;Daddy&quot;, which freaks Leela out.[[File:Zapp.jpg|thumb|300px|Zapp proposing to Munda ]]\n\n===Act III===\n\nMunda and Zapp walk away, with Leela chasing after them and threatens her mother, but her mother tells her to back off. Morris then appears through a rist and Leela tells him about what just happened and pleads him to do something, but Morris does not seem to care and continues surfing.\n\nThe rest of the crew is then shown preparing to go for the wedding, but Leela decides not to go. Fry tells her that she should be happy about her mother, and manages to convince Leela to support her mother's decision and attend the wedding. Later, Leela is shown in a bridesmaid's costume and approaches Munda, surprising her. Leela apologizes Munda and decides to support her wedding. At the wedding, Leela escorts Munda down the red carpet as the wedding anthem is played by Raoul, with Zapp awaiting at the altar. Zapp and Munda are exchanging marriage vows, but gets interrupted by the Carcarons. Zapp then remembers about the peace treaty and is forced to postpone the wedding. At the same time, Morris falls off from the Planet Express ship's septic tank and punches Zapp in the stomach, stating that he still loves Munda and that he needs to take harsh action.\n\nDuring the meeting, Zapp reveals to Munda that he is tricking the Carcarons into signing a fake peace treaty, which declars war on them instead. This horrifies Munda, who then decides to call off the wedding and tells the Carcarons of Zapp's plan, causing them to declare war back, ironically. The Carcarons then begin attacking the [[Nimbus]], causing it to be immobilized. Leela then asks whether there is an auxiliary control panel for the ship, with Kif replying that there is but it is located outside of the ship and has 20 buttons to be controlled. Morris then reveals his feet, which has ten toes each and proceeds to operate the auxiliary control panel, which makes the ship act like a giant surfing board which follows the wave-like attacks made by the Carcarons. Munda then asks Morris why is he doing it when he is afraid of space, with Morris replying that there is nothing to fear and noting that the universe is like one giant sewer. Munda is glad over it and asks Zapp to apologize to the Carcarons in their language for deceiving them into entering a war. The Carcarons accepts the apology and both parties signs the actual peace treaty. Morris and Monda decides to reunite again, but Zapp asks whether he still can be with Munda, causing Morris to punch him in the stomach again. The final scene shows Morris holding Munda on his arms, surfing across space with the words &quot;Just Remarried&quot; attached to the back of the surfboard.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 7]]"

Nixon's head|Nixon]], who promises a fence around the solar system to keep away &quot;illegal space aliens.&quot; Leela agrees with the views of one senator named [[Chris Z. Travers]], and becomes his campaign manager.  [[Bender]] and Nixon attempt to find embarrasing facts on Travers, as Nixon is losing ground in the campaign, but nothing arises except his middle name &quot;Zaxxar&quot;, which Nixon then turns into the rumor that Travers was not born on Earth.  Bender then throws a rally in front of Traver's campaign headquarters, demanding that Travers show his &quot;Earth Certificate.&quot;  [[Fry]], Leela and Bender (Bender going with his political enemies to prove that crime knows no political boundaries) go the hospital that Travers admitted he was born in, and find an Earth Certificate stating his mother was admitted that morning.  Travers appears and tells the crew that he time-traveled back from a future where the fence Nixon builds did keep out aliens. An unforeseen side affect of this fence is that there is no longer a source of &quot;cheap alien labor,&quot; specifically farm workers, math teachers and &quot;the ones that do all the immunizations&quot; (doctors).  The economy fails, and Nixon turns the &quot;Silent Majority&quot; into Soylent Majority, a take on Soylent Green. After the financial crash of the possible future, it is revealed that robots do all of the work.  The robots rebel, led by Bender.  Travis traveled back in time (by using the same code used in Bender's Big Score) to run against Nixon and prevent this future.  In a bold move to secure the voter's confidence, his live birth is broadcast on national TV, in which Travers assists his mother to deliver himself.  This pleases the patrotic Earthicans, who had agreed with Travers that &quot;being born in front of them&quot; would certainly prove that he was from Earth.\n\nTravers wins the election.  As he approaches the podium to give his victory speech, Amy turns and asks Bender why he is not upset at the result.  Bender casually answers &quot;watch this&quot; as Travers begins to fade from existence.  Bender explains that since Nixon lost, the future that produced Travers and the time-travel scheme no longer exists, therefore the Travers that won the election no longer exists.  With no opposition, Nixon wins the election.  As the crew ponder this strange turn of events, all the actions of the past few days gets erased.  Leela struggles to remember the name of the person she has been working for, as Hermes mentions that they &quot;never left this room&quot; in the Planet Express building.\n\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

They go on the trip, seeing such exhibits as [[Jurassic Tank]] (featuring a Tyrannosaurus Rex trying to tread water). Bender tries to take a photo of all of them together, revealing that he uses actual film that he develops inside himself rather than traditional digital photos. He spends a ridiculous amount of time adusting to details such as light and exposure, but then ditches the crew as he spots Calculon. Bender follows Calculon snapping photos, annoying him as Bender interrupts his studio-mandated day with the actors that play his family on the soap opera. Zoidberg tells Bender to sell his photos to Us People magazine, which he does after initially insulting Zoidberg about the suggestion.\n\nBender becomes a paparazzo, excited when he learns that he will be paid to be annoying. He takes pictures of many celebrities, but becomes especially interested in the actor [[Langdon Cobb]] after watching a documentary about him. Cobb, as the documentary reveals, has always worn a bag over his head, and nobody has ever seen his face. Bender decides to get a picture of Cobb without his bag. He breaks into Cobb's property, and in the process is chased by Cobb's guard fungus, which looks like a dog covered in lichen and mushrooms. Bender manages to get a photo of Cobb without the bag. Catching Bender, Cobb pleads him to never show the picture to anyone, explaining that he wears the bag so people will appreciate his acting and not his looks, and that there'd be consequences. Cobb even attempts to bribe Bender not to develop the photo, but Bender does anyway. Bender shows [[Fry]] the picture, and beams of light pour from Fry's mouth and eyes as his body deflates like a balloon. To confirm the effect, Bender shows the picture to [[Hermes]] and [[Amy]], both of which also deflate after light erupts from their faces. Professor [[Farnsworth]] saves Zoidberg from the same fate, tearing up the picture and discovers that [[Langdon Cobb]] is from [[Bryoria 6]], home of the quantum lichen people. These are a race of people who feed on the admiration of their prey. However if someone sees their face, even in a photo, their life force will be sucked out and captured by the Bryorian's ego. Bender was immune because he had no life force. Each quantum lichen person is composed of two parts: an attractive algae-based id, and a ravenous fungus-based ego, the latter of which stores the stolen life forces of those who have seen the id. Professor Farnsworth determines that the only way to get the stolen life forces back is to destroy Cobb's ego, which turns out to be the fungus-dog that chased Bender earlier. The remaining crew attempt to weaken Cobb's ego at the World Acting Championship by helping Calculon, as a weakened ego will be more easy to destroy. Calculon, wanting to outdo Cobb whom he has lost to 7 years running, decides to do the death scene out of Romeo and Juliet using real poison, as he believes that his real death will finally let him win the competition. However, Cobb wins anyway, and his ego begins growing out of control and attacks the crowd. The crew fights Cobb's ego as Bender develops the picture of Cobb from the negative that he kept. Cobb explains he was once like the rest of his people, stealing the life out the population of one planet and moving on, but found that humans elevate a celebrity to the point where a being like him can feed just from the worship Earth pours on him, granting a never-ending supply of food. He then shows his face to Professor Farnsworth, [[Leela]] and [[Zoidberg]], turning them into flaccid husks to protect his secret.  Bender attempts to destroy the id part of Cobb by showing him a photo of himself, but Cobb explains that this won't work. However, Cobb becomes so self absorbed in the image Bender has taken, that his ego inflates to the point of exploding, returning all of the stolen life forces to the Planet Express crew.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Kif gets nervous when Amy asks him to decide which water Elzar offers, but manages to make his choice. Amy then comments on the boots Leela was wearing, causing Fry to make cat-like noises. Leela asks Fry to knock it off, stating that girlfriends always talk trash to each other. When Leela comments about Amy's dress, Fry makes some more cat-like noises. Amy asks him to knock it off too, and states that if girlfriends talk politely to each other, there is a problem between them.\n\nThe next day, the [[Planet Express]] crew has to deliver big, heavy moonrocks to the [[Moon]], which [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] claims that the Apollo astronauts apparently stole them and that they have to return them back to the Moon because they are part of their cultural heritage. Amy and Leela then begin to trash talk with each other, which again causes Fry to make the cat-like noises, ending with a moonrock falling on him. As the crew arrives on the Moon, they then deliver the now slightly lighter moonrocks to the Moon [[farmer]], who actually wants the rocks to build a fence around his herd of [[Buggalo]]es. Leela asks him whether the moonrocks are really the Moon's cultural heritage, but the Moon farmer just brushes it off, exclaiming that they are a bunch of big city-dummies who got scammed into bringing back the rocks out of shame.\n\nThe farmer then informs them that if they want to see some real Moon culture they should come down to the Butterfly Derby on the same night. The crew then heads to the arena, where inside two girls are shown flying around, wearing a pair of butterfly wings on their arms and light, skimpy outfits. Leela comments that she wasn't expecting this as it is quite elegant and serene. As soon as she is finished an announcement is made, introducing the reigning champions of the Butterfly Derby, the [[Murderflies]]. They then begin fighting the two other girls, with Leela commenting that this is what she has expected. They then make quick work of the former two ladies. As their opponents lay defeated on the floor, the derby's host, [[Abner Doubledeal]], tells the audience that there is a weekly Amateur Flapdown, where two [[File:634057-comedy_central_futurama_the_butterjunk_effect_01.jpg|thumb|300px|Amy and Leela in action]]volunteers from the audience can come to the stage and compete against The Murderflies for a winning prize of 50 bucks. Amy and Leela decide to volunteer. They both put up a good fight against the Murderflies, but are eventually defeated. After the fight, Abner decides to offer Amy and Leela a place in the Butterfly Derby, as they are constantly looking for 'fresh blood', to which Amy and Leela agree.\n\n[[Bender]] is then heard narrating Amy and Leela's career in the Butterfly Derby. Amy and Leela decide to call it quits, since they have lost 15 matches in a row. But then they spot a trainer supplying 'Nectar' to two competitors of the Butterfly Derby, with one of them stating that it really gives a performance boost. They then approach the trainer, who agrees to sell some of her supply to them. Amy and Leela decides to give it a try, and instantly feel the effects.\n\nAs the crew is watching the news, which is showing Amy and Leela's rise of their Butterfly Derby career.  The two then appear, having gained muscle mass, acting more aggresively and constantly drinking Nectar. Amy and Leela are then shown winning another round in the Butterfly Derby.  Abner announces that they will face the Murderflies in their next match for the championship title, as the two teams exchange taunts with each other. After the match Amy and Leela approach the trainer for some more Nectar, but the trainer says that the Murderflies have bought all of her Nectar supply. Fry and Kif are complaining about how they cannot get their girlfriends attention anymore. Amy and Leela then walk in and wonder how they are going to get more Nectar.  Professor Farnsworth then reveals the Nectar comes from Kif's home planet and suggest that they can go there to collect some more Nectar for themselves. Kif begins to get worried, but Fry asks him to play along, as he sees this as an opportunity to go on a romantic trip together with their girlfriends. Bender appears suddenly, all geared up to go on vacation.\n\n[[File:ImagesCARF2JSU.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Kif calling his parents]]As they land on Kif's home planet, butterflies are seen flying everywhere. The crew arrives at the Butterfly Reserve Park, where the [[Grand Midwife|Grand Butterfly Curatorshows]] up and warns them that it is now the butterfly mating season and asks them not to disturb the Male Butterfly, whom she describes as having orange colouring and having enourmous 'butterjunk'. The Curator then warns them about danger, but due to legal issues, cannot specify what the danger is (in case something else happens and she becomes liable). They split into teams, and while Amy and Leela manage to find the Nectar they are looking for, Bender, Kif and Fry stumble upon the male butterfly.  Bender decides to smash it and pulls out a hammer. Kif tries to warn him, but Bender ignores him and walks closer to it. The male butterfly then flies up in the air, ready to shoot his pheromones in self defense. Fry cowers behind Bender, but as the male butterfly shoots his pheromones, Bender quickly hides his head causing the pheromones to strike Fry. Kif comments that the pheromone smells like &quot;a skunk filled with feta cheese.&quot; Later, the crew arrives at Kif's parents' house, where they are invited to spend the night. Kif's parents then set some rules, asking the males and females to sleep in separate rooms. Kif's parents notice that Fry smells awful, with Fry admitting to it and deciding to take a shower.  Amy then kisses Kif goodnight, but Leela finds herself strangely attracted to Fry and begins seducing him.  Leela then asks Fry to leave his bedroom door unlocked, with Fry being confused at first but then getting what Leela meant  \n[[File:Untitled.png|thumb|300px|Amy and Leela being attracted to Fry]]\n\nLeela is seen sneaking out of her bedroom.  There is a knock on Fry's bedroom door, and Fry invites the person inside.  They begin to make out under the covers, but then Leela then shows up, the person Fry is in bed with revealed to be Amy. Bender comes out from the bathroom and becomes surprised over the situation, dropping Fry's toothbrush and towel around him. The next morning, Leela and Amy begin arguing about last night's incident, while constantly making out with Fry at the same time. Back at the Planet Express the two girls continue to make out with Fry, which makes Professor Farnsworth scan him with a miniature version of his [[Smell-O-Scope]]. Professor Farnsworth finds out that Fry's sex appeal is a result of the pheromones that were sprayed on him by the male butterfly, and with the girls being overdosed on Nectar, they act like female butterflies wanting to mate with Fry. Professor Farnsworth explains that the only way for them to end this is to go [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_turkey cold turkey], with Amy and Leela agreeing to do so. At the same time Fry starts to feel &quot;caterpillary&quot;, and starts inching on the floor like the insect.\n\nAmy and Leela manage to kick their Nectar addiction, with Amy apologizing to Kif over her unruly behaviour. The ladies have lost all of the mass the Nectar gave them in their &quot;flapping muscles&quot; within a matter of days. Leela then notices that Fry has gone missing, when the camera pans to Fry, wrapping himself into a coccon on the Planet Express spaceship's left wing.  Abner then shows up on the video screen, stating that their match against the Murderflies is about to begin. The crew quickly rushes to the Butterfly Derby arena.\n\nAt the match Leela thanks Amy for sticking together as they were recovering from their Nectar addiction, with Amy asking what's the worst that can happen (Amy: Hot lava?!?).  Abner announces that since this is a championship match the floor will be replaced with lava instead.  Since they have been weaned off the Nectar, Leela and Amy don't have the competitive edge as before, and the Murderflies make quick work of the two. Outside, Fry is about to emerge from his cocoon. The Murderflies are shown tearing off Amy and Leela's butterfly wings and are about to drop them into the lava, when Fry shows up in butterfly form.  The Murderflies find themselves attracted to Fry (or as they put it, that awesome stank) and they begin to mate with him publicly.  Abner is forced to call off the match, while Leela claims that she felt kinda left out of the action.\n\nBack at Planet Express, Leela asks whether Fry can return back to his original state, with Professor Farnsworth stating that he couldn't, and that Fry's brain activity is now at zero. Suddenly Fry's butterfly form begins to crack, revealing that Fry is still intact in his human form, including clothes. The crew then cheers happily, as Fry remains dazed and continues acting strangely.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Even though Hermes schemes to fire [[Zoidberg]] for no reason, the plan backfires. Amy, as the Professor's intern is proved useless, due to the Professor napping all day. Leela is proved useless, and could teach Fry or Bender to fly the ship. She notes that Hermes is standing on their air hose, and when Hermes releases the air, it pops Fry and Bender's suits, leaving Bender looking normal and Fry naked. Scruffy is pointed useless as well as Zoidberg, but in the end promptly fires himself due to his arrogance and stupidity. As a replacement, the [[Central Bureaucracy]] hires a robot named [[Mark 7G]] to perform the bureaucratic tasks for Planet Express.  Zoidberg exclaims that he will miss Hermes despite all the torment and bullying he received because he thought that the insults from Hermes were jokes. Back at his home, Hermes says that the best part of being fired is that he will never have to see Zoidberg again. The family dines on curried goat, which is so spicy that a drop spilled burns through the table, various apartments (including through a drunk guy's belly) and all the way down to [[Robot Hell]], where it burns through the head of the [[Robot Devil]].  Hermes feels sad and talks to his wife, LaBarbara, who tries to cheer him up as they go out for a walk.  Out of nowhere [[Roberto]] appears and tries to mug them for their skin, pointing several knives at them. [[File:Unavngivet.png|thumb|left|294px|Hermes and Bender meets Yuri]]Fortunately, [[URL]] and [[Smitty]] rescue them and sends Roberto to the Electromagnetic Chair (at one point Roberto remarked that the chair was &quot;driving him sane&quot;).  Hermes talks to Bender and as they talk, Fry eavesdrops on their conversation, with a few distractions from Leela and Amy, who are naked in the shower. Later that night Bender brings Hermes [[Yuri]], who runs a black market selling used robotic and organic parts and is able to do body augmentation. Hermes gets a harpoon installed in his chest.\n\n===Act II===\n\nHermes shows his new attachment, which impresses the crew and helps to get his job back.  As Zoidberg greets Hermes, who starts to become mean to him again as always, [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] drops his dentures down in the sink and Bender shows how easily it could be retreived by an extending arm, convincing Hermes that he should get one.  Hermes pays Yuri a visit again, replacing his left arm with a robotic extendable arm, and shows off its numerous attachments after Farnsworth again drops his dentures into the insinkerator.  Zoidberg asks for and takes Hermes' organic left arm.  Back in his dumpster, Zoidberg is shown playing with a makeshift puppet of Hermes, fitting Hermes's old arm onto it.  In bed that evening, Hermes breaks his glasses with his new robotic hand and decides to get a Cylon eye instead, surprising his wife [[LaBarbara Conrad|LaBarbara]].  Hermes smooths it over and the two are about to make love, when LaBarbara realizes that Hermes also Cyloned his private area.  LaBarbara makes him promise that he will not upgrade any further, but he crosses his robotic fingers behind his back.[[File:Hermes.jpg|thumb|300px|Hermes as a robot]]\n\nSoon after, Hermes breaks his promise to LaBarbara, and has upgraded all of his body parts except for his brain.  Zoidberg has been collecting Hermes'es old body parts, prompting Hermes to ask what he plans to do with them, and Zoidberg replying &quot;something wonderful&quot;.  Zoidberg laments that the new and improved Hermes doesn't joke with him the way he used to.  The Hermesbot couldn't care less what Zoidberg does at this point.  It is revealed that Zoidberg has sewn all of Hermes' discarded parts together to create &quot;Little Hermes&quot;, a puppet whom he uses in his comedy ventriloquist act where Little Hermes insults him much as Hermes did when he was organic. Everyone thinks Little Hermes is funny, and Dr. Zoidberg is funny for the first time, but the now emotionless and arrogant Hermesbot finds it disgusting and decides to make the ultimate and completely suicidal decision: getting a robot brain, which will kill any remaining humanity. Hermes pays a visit to Yuri again, but this time, the surgeon refuses to fulfill Hermes' request, stating that he's out of his mind.  Later, Hermes visits the robot cemetary together with Professor Farnsworth and Bender, where they stumble upon a fresh grave. The grave is then exhumed and Professor Farnsworth retrieves the brain circuit in it. As they leave, it is revealed that the grave belongs to the recently executed Roberto.\n\n===Act III===\n\nBack at Planet Express, Professor Farnsworth and the crew prepare for surgery, as Zoidberg performs a quick comedy session with Little Hermes.  LaBarbara shows up with Dwight and demands that the surgery is stopped.  Hermes points out that a robot brain would make him a better husband and father, but LaBarbara replies that he can't be a husband and father without a wife and son and commences divorce proceedings.  Professor Farnsworth then gets emotional and refuses to perform the surgery because he knows that the procedure will kill Hermes.  Hermesbot locks the crew inside the Planet Express building until they perform the brain swap.  Zoidberg says he will do it, using Little Hermes'es fingers for dexterity.  The rest of the crew wonder why Zoidberg wants to perform such a risky and suicidal surgery on Hermes, even with the threat of death by Hermesbot, and Zoidberg answers them in a musical way.  Amy asks if anyone else thinks that is it strange that Dr. Zoidberg can harmonize with himself while singing.\n\nThe surgery is successful, and LaBarbara is upset. As LaBarbara berates Dr. Zoidberg for performing the operation, Zoidberg puts Hermes' brain into Little Hermes, and Hermes is once again fully human, apologizing to LaBarbara for breaking his promise to her. As they share a kiss together, Roberto awakens in Hermes' robot body. He captures Hermes and peels part of his skin with the robot arm's vegetable peeler attachment, then eats it. Roberto ends up melting completely due to Hermes' goat curry saturated skin, killing him instantly.  LaBarbara then asks Hermes to apologize to Zoidberg for being a jerk to him, and to thank him for saving Hermes and Labarbara's marriage. Hermes does so despite him stating that he hates Zoidberg so much and how they've never been friends.  Zoidberg then decides to stand up to Hermes after hearing that both of them have &quot;never been friends&quot; and uses Hermes as a puppet again.  He then says &quot;Ouch ! what a zinger! Well I got one for you Mr. Not my friend conrad. You acted like a big jerk ! You were selfish and stupid and you don't deserve a wife like Labarbara or a friend like me&quot;. Everyone around the room then laughs and Zoidberg then leaves the place dancing to his &quot;Monster Mash&quot; spoof, much to the chagrin of Amy, who again, asks aloud whether anyone else is wierded out by Zoidberg harmonizing with himself as he sings.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

As the Robot Mafia manages to flee, the truck drivers grimace over their unfortunate loss.\n\nIn the [[Planet Express]] [[Planet Express building|building]] , the crew is seen relaxing as [[Bender B. Rodriguez|Bender]] exclaims that he's bored. Amy then stood up and suggets that they should visit her parents' casino in Mars Vegas. The crew is then seen preparing to head to Mars when Zoidberg shows up with his penny jar. Amy then mentions that Mars Vegas isn't the most suitable place for Zoidberg because he has poor money management skills, as Bender's arm was seen slipping into Amy's handbag taking some of her cash inside it. Amy then states that Zoidberg better just stay behind, leaving Zoidberg dejected. Zoidberg is then seen heading to his dumpster.[[File:Episode_11_-_Viva_Mars_Vegas-(004272)15-29-40-.jpg|thumb|300px|The Robot Mafia's loot being dropped in front of Zoidberg]]\n\nAs the Robot Mafia's car is seen passing by an advertising board, [[URL]] and [[Smitty]], who were hiding behind it proceed to chase after the Robot Mafia's car together with a fleet of police vehicles.

Amy's parents then took the crew to a tour of their Wong Hotel and Casino. [[Fry]] notices that most of their staff are native Martians, where Leo states that they are excellent as they're grouchy people. Leela states they at least work for minimum wages but they do not make full use of their land, as Amy explains that when her ancestor, Reginald Wong discovered them they had no bingo parlor and only one prostitute, with Bender exclaming it's pathetic. The 'uncomplimentary' shrimp buffet section is then shown, as a disposal team is shown changing the shrimp platter, which is done on a weekly basis. The crew is then taken to the casino's vault, where workers are shown counting the casino's takings.[[File:Episode_11_-_Viva_Mars_Vegas-(006867)16-27-24-.jpg|thumb|300px|The casino's vault]] Bender gets attracted to the money, causing his eyes to off,and decides to pilfer some of it, only to be stopped by [[Blind Joe]] who hammers Bender's hand. Inez tells that they better don't mess with Blind Joe, as he has a strong smelling ability. Leo proceeds to show the casino's vault, calling it the galaxy's most secure safe. He then explains that at 3.45pm, the casino's take is stored inside the vault. He also explains that it is also a machine that separates suckers from their money, as it announces that a category 5 sucker has arrived.\n\nOutside the casino's main entrance, a platform that guests were walking flips over to a red carpet look as the guests walking on it is felled over. A limousine is then seen stopping in front of it as the bell boys stood in position to greet its guest. Zoidberg is revealed to be inside the limousine, giving off tips to the bell boys. Zoidberg is then placing tokens on the jackpot machines, with all of it hitting the jackpot. Zoidberg then wears a suit made from cash, for which he tore the left sleeve of the jacket placing it in the tips jar. He is then seen inside a bubble jacuzzi with two ladies as acrobats perform in the front. One of the acrobats swiped down to take a tip Zoidberg was handing out. A white tiger was seen growling but was silenced by Zoidberg giving it a tip, as a dolphin from inside the jacuzzi leaps out to grab another tip handed out by Zoidberg. The Planet Express crew then appears, with Leela asking what is he doing here and [[Hermes]] asking whats with all the money. Zoidberg then states that it is his 8 million dollars that apparently God gave to him, with the [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor]] exclaming that God didn't become that way by giving away money. Zoidberg then tells the Professor to loosen up as he proceeds to head down to the casino, taking his money along. Amy then states that this is why a poor person is not seen with millions of dollars.\n\nZoidberg arrives at a roulette table where a chip costs a million dollars. He then requests for 8 of the chips, betting away all of his money. He then decides to place all of his chips on 34 red, with the casino worker proceeding to spin the roulette. Amy then exclaims what is he doing, with Zoidberg replying that he doesn't know as other guests made their way to the roulette table.\n\n[[File:Episode_11_-_Viva_Mars_Vegas-(009879)17-19-00-.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Zoidberg hits the jackpot]]\n\nZoidberg hits the jackpot, winning $288 million and startling all the guests beside him. He then decides to bet all of his chips on the same number, startling everyone (even Amy's parents). He then hits the jackpot again, winning $10,368,000,000, surprising the guests again. Zoidberg proceeds to treat vodka with a sardine on top to everyone all round and decides to stake everything on the same number again. Unfortunately for him this time, the roulette stops at 15 black, making him lose everything. Amy then angrily asks why Zoidberg has to lose everything, who then says that is just 'easy come, easy go' as he had made everyone happy, and for that it made him a winner as an announcement stating 'category 5 loser now departing' is made.\n\n[[File:Episode_11_-_Viva_Mars_Vegas-(011961)17-25-37-.jpg|thumb|300px|Zoidberg being interrogated by the Robot Mafia]]\n\nLater at night, as Zoidberg returns to his dumpster the Robot Mafia is revealed to be waiting for him inside it, with Donbot asking for the money or Zoidberg's life, causing him to spit out the vodka he drank earlier in the casino. The Robot Mafia proceed to interrogate Zoidberg who claims that he has spent all the money on Mars Vegas as Clamps hits a book on his face. They then decide to believe in him and plan to murder and dispose him. As Clamps approaches for the kill Zoidberg gets frightened and splashes his ink all over, blinding his captors and allowing him to escape. In the Planet Express building, the crew is shown trying to recover their hangover from their weekend trip to Mars Vegas. The Professor asked where's his ship, to which Leela points to the roof where she apparently crashed the ship into. Fry then states he doesn't remember much, but he felt fine. Amy then points her mirror to Fry, to which it is revealed that tattoos are shown at Fry's left side of his face, with him exclaiming that Amy's mirror is the one who got the tattoos. The Professor then states that he's prepared for this eventuality, while starting up his tattoo\n\n[[File:Episode_11_-_Viva_Mars_Vegas-(014443)22-44-57-.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Zoidberg being turned invisible by the tattoo removal laser]]\n\nremoval laser, which the Professor describing it as a &quot;translucidating ink polarizer&quot;. [[File:Episode_11_-_Viva_Mars_Vegas-(014064)22-40-46-.jpg|thumb|Fry being shot at by the Professor's &quot;translucidating ink polarizer&quot;]]Fry then asks whether it is less painful than regular tattoo removal, to which the Professor activates it on Fry, causing him to scream in pain. Zoidberg then appears, asking to be hidden from the Robot Mafia that is chasing after him. As Fry drops away after all of his tattoos are removed by the tattoo removal laser Zoidberg got hit by the laser, which caused him to turn invisible. The Professor proceeds to turn off the machine, with him explaining that because Zoidberg is saturated with ink it completely polarized him. Joey and Clamps then appeared through the entrance door, guns pointed. Zoidberg exclaims that he isn't here, prompting them to leave, but not before giving a warning (inadvertently beating Zoidberg) and claiming that there is some sort of weird smell at the area, as Zoidberg collapses to the ground.\n\nBack at the Wong's hotel and casino, the Robot Mafia were seen hanging out at the bar as Donbot says that they're unable to get back their money from Zoidberg. Joey then claims that the casino they're in can make lots of money for them and suggest Donbot to get involved in the casino business. Donbot exclaims that he's an idiot, but he takes Joey's idea into plan and proceed to put it in action. Leo is seen playing miniature golf in his office when the Robot Mafia bursts in, asking him to hand over his casino. Leo then jokingly states that they can have it while he retires back to his mansion. Later, it is shown that the Wongs are evicted from their mansion and that the Planet Express crew is helping to move away all their stuff. Amy is shown consoling her mother and suggests that she come live with her. Inez declines, stating who has been paying her rent, with Amy asking what is rent. The scene then shifts to the Wongs' employee housing area, which resembles a caravan site. Inez then states that it is the only place they can afford now, as Bender asks whether he can place their stuff down or not. Later that night, Amy is seen taking a bath, crying away as a tissue is seen floating to wipe away her tears. Amy then thanked what she claimed to be a tissue ghost, but it is revealed to be Zoidberg. Amy then asks if Zoidberg snuck in while she was bathing, to which Zoidberg replies that she snuck in to the bath while he was eating a bar of soap (which he calls a bubble cake). Amy then states that she owes him an apology for condescending him for his poverty and realizes that it can happen to anyone. Zoidberg forgives her and asks whether he can do anything to help. Amy says no, but suddenly she gets an idea on how to make things right. She states that they can pull off a daring casino heist, taking Zoidberg's invisibility to their advantage. Zoidberg agrees, as no one knows what he is up to as he proceeds to use the toilet, startling Amy.\n\n[[File:Episode_11_-_Viva_Mars_Vegas-(019195)00-10-18-.jpg|thumb|300px|Amy discussing plans of the casino heist]]\n\nBack at the Planet Express building, Amy discusses the plans in pulling off a casino heist in order to get back the money the Robot Mafia has taken away and return them to its rightful owners with the crew inside the chart room. She plans that Zoidberg were to walk in the vault as it is opened at 3.45pm and take away the money. Fry then asks that the Robot Mafia might notice that Zoidberg is taking away the money and start shooting him, but Amy explains that Zoidberg will be eating the money since whatever he eats will turn invisible, as shown with the donut he is holding with. Hermes then claims that with Zoidberg eating all of that money, it will cause him to weigh over 300 pounds and asks how are they to carry him away, with Leela also stating that he smells and that they can't escape with anyone noticing his smell. [[File:Episode_11_-_Viva_Mars_Vegas-(022920)00-42-11-.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Amy, Fry, Leela and an invisible Zoidberg making their way to the vault]]Amy then asks the crew to be on their toes and says she'll explain as the heist begins. Later on that day, at exactly 3.30pm the hotel's signboard is shown changing from Wong's Hotel and Casino to Mob Hotel and Casino as the Planet Express crew lands on the roof. Amy explains that the key to the whole operation lies in their shrimp buffet. As it was Friday, Amy explains that the week old shrimp platter is due for change and the Professor and Zoidberg is seen approaching the shrimp buffet. Zoidberg picks some of the shrimp to eat as he felt hungry, but the Professor scoffs him, saying that he needs to keep his stomach empty as possible to eat the 300 pounds of money they're planning to steal. At exactly 3.40 pm, Leela, Fry and Amy disguise themselves as the disposal team to take away the week-old shrimp as the original disposal team is tied and gagged in the lift. As they are doing so Amy explains that ten floors above, the vault is being opened. As the casino's takings are stashed into the vault, Blind Joe notices a weird smell. Donbot asks him to shut it, and says that it's only just the shrimp cart. As Amy, Fry and Leela make their way to the vault Zoidberg, which is on the cart claims that he feels unwell, to which Amy asks him to stop griping and eat everything that's in the vault, especially the little metal box which is the most valuable thing of all stored inside it.\n\n[[File:Episode_11_-_Viva_Mars_Vegas-(026866)01-01-30-.jpg|thumb|300px|The crew making their escape]]They then proceed to put their plan in action, with Leela kicking off a wheel on the cart and complaining about it, serving as a distraction to allow Zoidberg to enter the vault and eat the contents stored in it. Amy then says that once Zoidberg enters the vault, they need to distract the Donbot so that he doesn't close the safe prematurely. The Donbot decides to close the safe early, but gets distracted by Bender who is dressed up as a cowboy. Bender is asked to step aside, making him call for backup to which Hermes, dressed in traditional African clothing appears to continue distracting the Donbot. Zoidberg continues to force himself to eat all of the money in the vault, including the metal box. The Professor, dressed as a billionaire hippie continues distracting the Donbot as Zoidberg exits the vault, stating that he is totally stuffed. The Donbot then asks what was that noise, with Hermes covering it up and stating that he, Bender and Hermes have to leave now in an unusual manner (carrying Zoidberg away). [[File:Episode_11_-_Viva_Mars_Vegas-(028630)01-07-57-.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Amy showing the contract signed by her ancestor Reginald]]They then placed Zoidberg onto the shrimp cart and proceed to leave. In the lift, they then make their way up to the roof but the lift starts to fall instead because of Zoidberg's over-excessive weight, and Amy says that they have to escape through the main entrance instead. They then quickly made their escape, as Zoidberg burps out some of the money he has swallowed. Amy asks him to try burping out singles only. Unfortunately as they approach the exit, Blind Joe is seen standing in front of them with his gun pointed out. He then reveals Zoidberg by blowing powder onto him, as the Robot Mafia appears and asks him to shoot him away. Amy manages to ask him to stop as she has a deal to offer. Blind Joe then puts his gun away whilst Amy makes Zoidberg burp out the metal box he ate. Amy then reveals a contract stored inside the metal box, signed by her ancestor which states that the Wong family were to hold the casino and the land for only a hundred years, to which after it would be handed over to the native Martians. The Robot Mafia is then carted away by the casino workers.\n\n[[File:Episode_11_-_Viva_Mars_Vegas-(030049)01-21-48-.jpg|thumb|300px|Amy and Zoidberg making their way to the other hotel and casino]]\n\nBack at the Wong Mansion, the Planet Express crew are moving the Wongs' belongings back inside it. Amy's parents then states that they may have lost their casino, but due to Amy's kindness it allowed the Martian natives to return back their mansion and their other hotel and casino, Wong's Island. Zoidberg then asks whether he will be invisible forever, to which the Professor says that he'll not remain invisible once he takes a bath, as he wipes off some of the invisible ink, revealing Zoidberg's nose. Amy tells Zoidberg that he can use the spa tub for his bath and then escorts him into the Wongs' other hotel and casino, as they both joyfully head towards it.\n\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 7]]"

Leela then leads a protest against this, since she didn't like the prospect of having an innocent animal killed for sport. She later finds the fox to be a robot. An outraged Bender begins protesting against robot abuse. Leela, however, is fine with the hunters' actions. Bender then proceeds to stop all robot abuse within a 20 mile area. Funnily, he doesn't actually make much progress. Fry asks if Bender is satisfied with their work, but Bender decides he has one more abuse to prevent. He then decides to stop the next hunt by letting the new robot fox loose. When the hunters find the cage, they only find an angry Bender. Since they have no fox to hunt, they decide to hunt Bender. Even though Bender had a 30 minute head start, he couldn't decide which path to take. The hunters then give him another 30 minutes. This time Bender takes advantage of it. He comes across the robot fox, which bites his finger off. He is later shown to have set up a trap in that time for the hunters. He grabs the hunter's gun, but it is implied he can't shoot him without his trigger finger, although he could probably find a way to pull it without it. Fry then gives him his finger back, yet Bender still says he can't shoot the hunter. He unwisely hands the hunter his gun back. Just before the hunter shot Bender, the robot fox attacked the hunter. The hunter ironically was a robot all along. Leela could not decide whether this was right or wrong. Later, Leela concurred that it was alright with her.                                          \n\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Stubs]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Upset with how the Professor treats him, Fry says that he wishes he had more family, to which [[Zoidberg]] replies that the Professor's parents are still alive in an old-age home called the Near-Death Star.\n\nFry, [[Bender]] and [[Leela]] all go to visit the elder Farnsworths and find that they live in a run-down, virtual retirement home where their bodies are used as batteries (which, Leela says, is an idea they got from the old movie, ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix The Matrix]''). The crew enters the virtual reality, and Fry connects with his relatives, whom he nicknames &quot;Gram-gram&quot; and &quot;Shabadoo&quot;. As they are preparing to leave, Fry kisses them goodbye but accidentally knocks one of the electrical plugs of their life-support system out of its socket. The automated security considers this &quot;Elder Abuse&quot; and begins attacking. Finding the cheap batteries in their vehicle dead, Leela grabs Gram-gram and Shabadoo and uses them as batteries to escape.\n\nThey take the elderly couple to [[Planet Express]], where they see their son for the first time in years, but to everyone's surprise, the Professor angrily tells them he doesn't want to see them again. Leela and [[Amy]] confront him about his sullen behavior while he's in the bathtub, and he tells the story of his childhood: According to Hubert, his parents never cared about his life, never spent time playing with him, and ruined his dream of going to college at age eleven by moving to a farm and not permitting him to leave. He runs off into the street completely nude and returns to the old farm where he grew up.\n\nFry, Leela, Bender, Gram-gram, and Shabadoo follow Hubert to the farm, and the Professor's parents tell him that he had an older brother who wanted to be a scientist. Although brilliant, the brother was mentally unstable and had frequent night terrors, keeping the parents up at nights to care for him. This was why they were always too tired to play with their children during the day. After running away, the brother had ended up in a mental institution (&quot;on a full whack-a-demic scholarship&quot;). However, when they finally mention the brother's name, Hubert, it becomes clear they were talking about the Professor himself, having mistaken him for his younger brother, Floyd. Floyd had left home to pursue his dream of being a rodeo clown. Gram-gram and Shabadoo never knew that Hubert had gotten out of the mental institution 25 years later.\n\nReconciling with his parents, Hubert offers to accompany them back to the Near-Death Star. Bender mentions that a homeless rodeo clown named Floyd had come to the door of the Planet Express building a few years earlier, but Bender is interrupted, and no one hears him. Back at the Near-Death Star, Hubert enters their virtual home with them and shows them that he has reprogrammed it to be an exact duplicate of their farm. At this point, Hubert's virtual avatar changes to him as a child, those of Gram-gram and Shabadoo become younger versions of themselves, and the three play together happily.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 7]]"

They grow up with each other, and decide that they should mate with each other when they return. After confusion Fry fish overcomes his instincts to return to his own home-streamand, and goes to Leela fish's side of the lake. They mate and die.\n\n==Part 2==\n\nOn the Galapagos Islands, Zoidberg is a Blue-Footed Booby, and Professor Farnsworth is depicted as a near-extinct Pinta Island tortoise, lonely and desperately trying to find the only mate of his sub-species on the island. The birds (Fry, Leela, Hermes and Amy) convince the old tortoise to make the long trip across the island to meet his only possible mate (Mom). Bender-iguana accompanies them. Amy is eaten by a Sal-snake, but once the remaining 5 arrive, the Professor-turtle mistakes a rock for Mom, and begins to mate with it. Mom-turtle walks up, enraged at what she see's, pushes the rock over a ledge and off the island. They mate, Mom lays 3 eggs, and they go off separately to die. Once hatched, the 3 new Pinta Island Tortoises (Walt, Larry &amp; Igner) and are immediately crushed by a rock, making the species extinct.\n\n==Part 3==\n\nBeachmaster (Bender) is the dominant male of a group of Elephant Seals. Leela and Amy (among others) are females in Beachmaster's harem, and Fry, Professor Farnsworth, Kif, Hermes and Randy are the beta-males, who have no chance to mate while in direct competition with Beachmaster. Scruffy the Walrus apparently hangs out with the beta-male elephant seals. Professor-seal tells the other beta-males that he once was able to mate with a female by sneaking past Beachmaster while he was mating with the Professor's mother, and finding a mate. Kif-seal decides to try this, so after Beachmaster rolls over onto all the children and tlls the women to repopulate with him, Kif brings Amy-seal a delicious treat from the ocean floor. As she's explaining that Beachmaster will kill Kif-seal and agreeing to his request to mate, Beachmaster notices the beta talking to a female and angrily saunters over. Kif-seal bravely challenges Beachmaster, but is crushed in the fight, which Beachmaster carries on long past when Kif-seal is dead and into the night. The next year new children have been born, and Bender-Beachmaster proclaims that it is a new litter spawned by him, despite the fact that they look almost exactly like Fry, Hermes, Randy and the Professor.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 7]]"

I should be happy. Bender's sausage just won 3rd place|Leela}}{{Quote|3rd place? This is the greatest injustice Germany has ever commited!|Bender}}\n\n'''Fun on a Bun''' is the eighth episode of production season seven and [[season 9 (broadcast)]]. It mainly focuses on [[Fry]] and [[Leela]], who lose their memories of each other.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nA sausage-making accident claims Fry as a victim during the crew's visit to Oktoberfest.\n\n==Plot==\n===Act I===\n[[File:Episode 08 - Fun on a Bun-(002210)10-57-19-.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Planet Express crew visiting Oktoberfest]] The crew is chilling out in the [[Planet Express]] living room when the [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor]] enters. He says that he thinks they work too hard, and he thought it might be nice to do something in a social setting and finally get to know each other. He recommends Oktoberfest in three months and the rest of the crew cheers happily.\n\nThree months later, they attend Oktoberfest in Germany. As Fry is from the 20th Century he is ready to party and drink some beer. But apparently Oktoberfest has now changed into a sophisticated exhibition of German food, drink, culture and a classy celebration of how humans have evolved. Leela tells Fry to be on his best behavior, but Fry still wants to drink - unfortunately he cannot even get [[Bender B. Rodriguez|Bender]] to join him. Bender walks away and passes by a Sausage Kompetition sign, deciding to join it. He then meets [[Elzar]] who tells him that he cannot paticipate in the competition with ordinary meat, stating that exotic meat is needed to stake a top placing in the competition. In the main tent, Fry is still trying to get more beer but it is hard for him to do so as it is a sophisticated event with the beer cups being kiddie sized. He then asks where all the beer comes from, with [[Hermes]] pointing that it comes from the large Oktober Brau barrel, which unfortunately for him it is guarded. He then finds another way by drinking beer from a large jar the other guests have spit out their beer in. Soon after he is drunk and dances on the table, surprising the other guests (even causing the Countess who was observing him to faint) and the rest of the crew say they are embarrassed of him, but Fry does not care, and even offers Leela to join him in getting drunk and doing the chicken dance on the able. Leela refuses and then exclaims that Fry's a neanderthal and an embarrassment, and decides to break up with him.\n\nFry is then seen sad and came across a disappointed Bender, who is upset because he cannot participate in the Sausage Kompetetion. They then stumble across a booth explaining the origins of Oktoberfest, which apparently begins at Neander Valley by [[Humans|Neanderthals]]. Bender also finds out that there were mammoths who were frozen in the ice for around 30,000 years, and decides to go to Neander Valley with Fry to look for some mammoths which he intends to make sausages from. Bender manages to retrieve a mammoth from the ice and uses a mulcher to make sausages out of the mammoth, with Fry helping to push the mammoth into the mulcher. But suddenly Fry's hair got stuck into the mulcher and is pulled inside it. Fry cries for help but Bender does not notice him and continues making the mammoth sausages.\n\nBack at Oktoberfest, a judge samples the mammoth sausages that Bener has made and finds it great, qualifying him for the next round. Leela then shows up with the rest of the crew and compliments Bender. Leela then asks if she could sample some of the sausages, with Bender giving her a mammoth hot dog to try for herself. As she is eating the hotdog, a speck of Fry's hair appears from her mouth, with [[Amy]] exclaming that the hair coming out from her mouth looks like Fry's. Leela dismisses this as a cruel joke, when she suddenly sees the sausage she was eating includes some of Fry's hair and bits of his clothing, making her scream in horror.\n\n===Act II===\nBack at the Planet Express building the crew gathers around a coffin where the sausage now lies. Leela becomes stricken with grief and begins crying. Later that day, she visits a forgettery salon where she asks her memories of Fry to be removed, which then shows the nerves inside her brains being cut off. The next day, Leela comes to work acting cheerful as the other members feeling gloomy, with Leela asking who had died. They then resume their work as usual, with Leela claming that they need to get a new delivery boy. Hermes then says that they need to accept that Fry's gone and that they need to move on with their lives.\n\nFry is then shown regaining consciousness frozen in a sheet of ice, trying to recall what had happened to him. A flashback is played to a week earlier where Bender was making the mammoth sausages with Fry. It was revealed that Fry managed to free himself from the mulcher, but not before it shreds his jacket, pants, shirt &amp; underwear and a piece of his hair. After pulling himself out, he then lands barely inches away from the hole they had dug up to retreive the mammoth, with Fry breathing a sigh of relief. But suddenly the ice beneath Fry breaks, causing him to fall into the hole.\n\nAs Fry lands in the hole he tries to get up, but is then knocked out by a cave rock. Fry then realizes he is trapped in the ice and calls for help. He then sees two shadows heading his way, who then raise their hammers and break Fry free from the ice. He then thanks those who released him, but gets surprised as he sees the missing Neanderthal world underneath the icy layer above. The Neanderthal male who released him asks how he got trapped in the ice, with Fry stating that he knocked his head hard. As he removes the chicken hat he was wearing it shows a large lump on his forehead, with the Neanderthal male claming it looks normal. Fry then asks who he is, with the Neanderthal female who rescued him saying that he is probably a Neanderthal too.\n\nBack at Planet Express, Leela, Bender, Hermes and Amy gets ready to deliver some goods to McPluto. Leela then asks what they are delivering, with Hermes stating that they are delivering hamburgers and French fries, trying to avoid mentioning the word 'fries'. He also then informs that they asks for the shipments every Saturday, actually covering up the fact that the shipments are wanted every Friday. Leela then spots the chicken hat Fry wanted to give her, stating that it is cute, but it makes her feel sad. Bender, Amy and Hermes, fearing that Leela might turn violent, escapes through the spaceship's escape pod.\n\nFry is then shown staring at a wild boar's tail, which resembles Leela's ponytail. The Neanderthal male asks why Fry is staring at the wild boar's butt, with him stating that it makes him feel happy and confused, but also sad and wistful. The Neanderthal female then states that the Neanderthals have always beeen sad and it is in their nature. Fry then asks why this is so, with the Neanderthal male explaining that 30,000 years ago in virtual Neander Valley, life for them was peaceful. When the Homosapiens arrived, the Neanderthals suggested that they should interbreed, creating one happy species. But the Homosapiens treated them like second-class commodities, driving them out from the valley and forcing them into an isolated crevice. Shortly thereafter, the sky above them became frozen, and that is why they are trapped underneath. Fry then realizes that his feelings of being called primitive and people refusing to mate with him are well placed.\n\nAt the Planet Express building, [[Scruffy]] retrieves a note attached to a raven and passes it to Bender. Bender than says that his mammoth sausages has made it to the finals of the competition and that they need to go back to Oktoberfest for the closing ceremony. Leela than looks at the chicken hat while wondering about Oktoberfest, causing the others to stare at her in fear. But then Leela says that it would be fun to go.\n\nAs Fry is seen scratching himself, a Neanderthal boy runs past to him to the Neanderthal Chief, stating that he has found a hole in the ice above that leads to the outside. Fry suggests that since they aren't trapped anymore they can finally take back the outside world from the Homosapiens, rallying his fellow Neanderthals to do so. Leela is then shown staring at a pumpkin whose color closely resembles Fry's hair color. Amy than asks Leela why she is staring at [[File:Episode 08 - Fun on a Bun-(020797)10-54-40-.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bender unhappy with his 3rd place in the sausage making competition]]the pumpkin, with Leela stating that it's something about the pumpkin's color which make her feel sad and confused. Leela then says she should feel happy, since Bender's sausage won 3rd place. Bender, however was not satisfied with his award. [[Zapp Brannigan|Zapp]] (as a sausage judge) and his assistant [[Kif]] appear on the table Leela is sitting at, trying to woo her as he always does. Suddenly, the ground beneath them starts to shake, causing them to run out from the tent to see the mountain in front of them crumble, revealing an army of Neanderthals on mammoths (with Fry on top of one of them), charging towards the Oktoberfest site.\n\n===Act III===\nAs the Neanderthals charge into the Oktoberfest site, Fry orders them to smash things. The crew then runs away, with Bender managing to get a few glasses of beer as the Professor slowly passes by. A mammoth is seen ramming through the arts tent, sticking a few paintings on its horn as a Neanderthal is shown smashing puppets from a clockwork. Bender then comes across the 2nd place sausage competition winner, putting him into a rhino's path and claming his 2nd prize sash and trophy. Fry then orders for the giant sloth to be released, with Leela and the others running away as Hermes stands still screaming in fright. As they try escape, a Neanderthal tries to attack them, but Leela easily dispatches him. Zapp then tells Leela not to fear and calls for his fleet of unmanned drones (with pilots in them actually). A mammoth is seen charging towards Zapp, causing him to drop the controller of the drones with the mammoth stepping on it, causing the drones to crash and explode on the ground. Hermes is then shown taking his time screaming as the sloth tries to attack him. Bender then notices the 1st prize winner of the sausage competition hiding beneath a table. Bender heads towards him and offers to protect him, carrying him on his back while giggling in an evil manner. A fleet of tanks is then shown shooting electric beams towards the mammoths, which only causes their fur to rise up. The mammoths head towards the large Oktoberfest Brau barrel, sucking out the beer inside it and spraying it towards the tanks, causing them to explode.\n\nThe [[Nimbus]] is then shown hovering over Fry, causing him to order the Neanderthals to prepare the catapult. Zapp is then seen inside, gloating about the technology that the Neanderthals do not possess. He then notices the catapult beneath him, which then fires a sabertooth tiger through the glass to attacK Zapp. The Nimbus then crashes onto the ground, but out of the smoke the Planet Express spaceship appears, fighting back with Leela piloting it. Leela heads towards the mammoth Fry is riding, as it takes the spaceship head on and slams it onto the ground. The two then duel it out on top of the Planet Express ship, with Fry stating that his people deserve the equality that they are entitled to have. Fry manages to knock off Leela's chicken hat, with Leela knocking off Fry's skull helmet in turn. As Leela is about to jab Fry's spear into him, she notices the orange color of Fry's hair while at the same time Fry notices the purple color of Leela's hair. After asking each other if they had met before, the two share a passionite kiss. The Neanderthal female wonders what Fry is doing with the homosapien woman, with the Neanderthal male stating that they're interbreeding. The rest of the Neanderthals then decide to stop fighting and make love with the other Homosapiens. The Neanderthal[[File:Episode 08 - Fun on a Bun-(029968)13-14-14-.jpg|thumb|300px|Leela performing the Chicken Dance]] Chief then sees the change made by Fry and Leela's kiss, and decides to seek peace with the homosapiens instead of war. Zapp agrees and decides to call the fight a draw, with the people around them cheering. Hermes is then seen being cuddled by the sloth. As Leela continues kissing Fry, she regains her memories of him, with the nerves in her brain joining back together. The lump on Fry's head then shrinks, and he remembers who Leela is as well. Bender then appears, showing off the 1st prize award he got from the original winner, whom he disposed of by throwing into a glacier.\n\nBack at the main tent the Neanderthals are seeing celebrating with the Homosapiens, dancing and drinking away. Bender is then shown serving a large mammoth rib steak to Zapp and the Neanderthal Chief, placing in on the table and causing it to tip over. Fry then states that this is the Oktoberfest he knew from his day, with Leela admitting that this version is more fun than the original. Leela then notices that the Chicken Dance song is playing and gets onto the table, offering Fry to join along. Fry declines and says that he'll let her embarrass him for once, as Leela proceeds to do the Chicken Dance.\n\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 7]]"

During his appearance, he was to deliver a speech to the latest police academy graduates, which included [[Philip J. Fry]] and [[Sound Effects 5000]]. Unfortunately, before he could reveal the only thing that can save an officer's life when the streets are &quot;flowin' with spit and blood,&quot; he dies due to a syntax error.

It aired on 10 July 2013, on Comedy Central. Bender becomes a famous firefighter, but the crew suspects him of arson.\n\n==Plot==\nAt a helium mining facility on the sun, Zapp Brannigan causes a cave-in that traps 15 miners inside the sun itself. Fry, Leela, and Bender venture to save the miners. When Bender attempts to abandon Fry and Leela and return to the ship, he inadvertently saves one of the miners. Prompted by Morbo, who is covering the breaking story on location, Bender goes on to rescue all of the remaining victims. He is hailed as the hero of the day, while Fry and Leela are recognized as his minor accomplices. A fire breaks out at their award ceremony, but as Mayor Poopenmeyer explains, the fire department was sold to pay for Bender's medal. Fry, Leela, and Bender put out the fire, although Bender is very showy about it and once again receives most of the credit. Poopenmeyer decrees that the Planet Express crew are now the city's fire department. \n\nAfter some time as successful firefighters, the other crew members notice that Bender was present just before every one of the fires they extinguished. They ask themselves whether Bender might be setting these fires deliberately in order to inspire continued hero-worship. Their suspicions are confirmed when, while on the videophone with Bender, they see a fire break out in the shop just behind him. When he returns to headquarters, they confront him and kick him off the team. \n\nAs Bender cleans out his locker, a strange, blue flame erupts from his shoulder. He tries to extinguish it, but the flame moves around as though deliberately dodging his attempts. Finally, the flame takes on the look of a shadowy face and begins to speak to Bender. It says that it is a &quot;being of pure solar energy,&quot; a member of a race that inhabits the Sun's photosphere. It explains that billions of years ago, it was imprisoned for treason, but that Bender has unwittingly transported it to Earth. When it announces its plans to ignite the earth and rule over it, Bender realizes that this creature is the source of the fires for which he has been blamed. When Bender accidentally leads it to the sub-basement and the lava pit, it realizes that it can go to Earth's core and transform the earth into a miniature sun. To prevent this, Bender captures the creature within his compartment of mystery and flees to an ice floe in the Arctic Ocean, where there is nothing flammable. He announces to the creature, which he begins to refer to as &quot;Flamo&quot;, that they will be here for the next billion years. \n\nAt home, Fry accepts a package that contains Bender's hero metal, badly damaged in the fire at the Vampire Bank where Bender had kept it. Fry realizes that Bender never would have set a fire that would risk harm to this prize, and flies to the Arctic to retrieve and apologize to Bender. But when Bender explains that &quot;it was a psychotic flame creature from the sun who set those fires,&quot; Fry decides that he must have been wrong about Bender after all. Fry angrily returns to headquarters alone. \n\nUnbeknownst to Fry and Bender, Flamo has escaped from Bender and attached itself to Fry's pants. At headquarters, it leaves Fry and ignites the Planet Express building itself. The crew are unable to extinguish the fire, as Flamo eludes their hoses. Just as they express relief that no one is left in the doomed building, Fry appears, hanging from the balcony and in need of rescue. Bender had discovered the loss of his captive earlier, and had left the Arctic just in time to arrive at this moment. He arrives such that only Fry knows of his presence, and quietly pulls him to relative safety. Fry refuses to be rescued, but Bender forces the issue. Fleeing with Fry in hand, Bender falls through the weakening floor, ending up in the sub-basement near the lava pit. Fry scolds Bender sharply and walks out on him, just as Flamo arrives and dives into the lava pit. Fry returns to scold Bender further, but Bender dives into the lava to capture Flamo. Before Fry can leave, a strange light draws him back into the room. Two large flame creatures appear, announcing that they are the &quot;mystic aldermen of the sun.&quot; They await Bender's return, thank him for his heroism in capturing their escapee, explain that he is &quot;now the greatest hero in Earth's history,&quot; and depart with a bound Flamo. \n\nFry finally understands the truth, and promises to vouch for Bender to the rest of the crew, but Bender explains that it cannot be. They wouldn't believe Fry either. And in fact, if Fry were to tell them that Bender is even present, they'll blame Bender for the fire. The only solution is for Fry to claim that he himself accidentally started the fire while Bender was thousands of miles away. \n\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season Ten]]"

He then deduces that all he needs is a guitar to fulfill his dreams. To get this guitar, he goes to Dr. [[Ben Beeler]], who now in addition to being a paleantologist is operating a 3D printing business.  Dr. Beeler locates the picture of Salmonella in Bender's Hard drive (among folders containing a penguin personality and over 100Tb of Porn) and connects Bender wirelessly to the printer, which then takes 4 or 5 hours to print the guitar out of nano-plastic (giving Ben and Bender some time to adjourn to the porn folder.)  \n\nBender names his new guitar Bender Mae and in his first gig attempts to steal the show from Silicon Red at a [[T.G.I. Folky's]], where he's immediately booed off stage for singing an insincere song, &quot;The Ballad of Me, Ramblin' Rodriguez.&quot;  Zoidberg suggests that in order to authenticate his music that he work on the railroad, so he makes his way to the wrong side of the tracks where he meets [[Big Caboose]] in a bar. \n\nCaboose begins to introduce Bender to the world of interstellar railways, though Bender essentially watches Caboose and others do the work he writes into his song from a lawn chair.  Fry and Leela meet him at a railroad camp to deliver some dynamite, and he sings them his song about Big Caboose, inserting a lyric about Caboose meeting a bad-hearted woman named Jezabel, which Caboose points out didn't happen.  Fry complains about the lyrics, still upset that Bender left him alone with the super villain.\n\nLater, as Bender is alone in his shack writing lyrics, Big Caboose comes in to announce that he has indeed met a fembot called [[Jezabel]], whom he introduces to Bender, then leaves with Bender.  After Caboose leaves, she laments that she's so lonely and easy, and predictably, she and Bender get busy.  He writes the escapade into the song, then writes Caboose's revenge into it, but decides to make it take place in New New York instead of the Rail Road Camp.\n\nMeanwhile, in New New York, Fry and Leela are watching a movie at Fry and Bender's apartment when Big Caboose knocks at the door looking to take his revenge on Bender.  They tell Caboose that Bender isn't there, and Caboose admitted that he knew that, but felt compelled by some strange force to look there anyway, so he leaves.  Fry and Leela realize at this point that Bender's song is coming to life, and Fry accuses reality of infringing Bender's intellectual property.\n\nBack at the railroad camp, Bender kicks Jezabel out of his shack and continues to write his ballad, deciding that Caboose will seek his revenge by running Ramblin' Rodriguez down with a train.  Predictably, Caboose shows up in an engine and chases Bender back to NNY on a push cart.  Bender makes it to his apartment, but Fry, still angry about Dr. Brutalov, refuses to let him in, quoting lyrics to Bender's song back to him.  Still pursued by Caboose, Bender escapes to Planet Express, where he again encounters Fry and Leela, who explain that they've been trying call him.  Bender acuses Fry of selling him out to Caboose, and Fry and Leela argue that it was a copy of Fry that sold him out-at which point Bender realizes that the copy must have been made by Dr. Beeler's printer.\n\nBender, Fry and Leela go back to Dr. Beeler's lab where Dr. Beeler realizes he left Bender's wireless connection open.  As Big Caboose's train whistle is heard in the distance, Leela suggests that instead of disconnecting Bender, they use the printer to solve their problem by having Bender write his way out of the situation in his song and having the printer (which is now much faster) create the solution, possibly using a giant octopus.  Bender objects, but of course he ends up creating a group of giant octopuses that attack the group.  Bender escapes to verify that the plural of octopus is octopi instead of octopuses, but discovers both are acceptable.  Leela then suggests that he create an alternate Bender for Big Caboose to kill, but Bender objects to this on the grounds that it violates his artistic integrety.  However, this is his downfall-Big Caboose crashes through the wall and runs over Bender with his train engine.\n\nA funeral for Bender is held at the Temple of Robotology, wherein Bender's body is so flattened that he is placed in a large manilla envelope.  Silicon Red eulogizes him by singing the last lyrics of &quot;The Ballad of Me, Ramblin Rodriguez&quot; in third person.  As he finishes the song,'' the real ''Bender bursts in the back door of the temple and reveals in song (double time now) that he indeed created a fake version of himself while the others were fighting the octopi, a version with the fatal flaw of artistic integrity which he introduced to make sure that the copy of himself wouldn't try to get out of getting killed by Caboose.  He then suggests to Silicon Red that they sell out together.\n\nRed, Bender and Caboose embark on a hip-hop career, telling their story in rap on stage at the Wong Casino in Mars Vegas, ending the show with an epic mic drop.\n\n== References ==\n\nWhen Caboose passes the sign to [[New New York]], the typeface is in New Yorker Type, used by ''The New Yorker'' magazine.\n[[Category:Season Ten]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Leela lets her curiosity get the best of her and opens the crate to discover that it holds weapons. She convinces [[Bender ]] to disable them by bending their barrels, pretending that they are the necks of tiny humans.\n\nWhen Planet Express Ship arrives at the territory of the Blips, identified by jerseys with Red on the right and blue on the left, [[Fry]] and [[Leela]] leave to make the delivery while Bender stays behind to watch the ship. Eventually they spot what they take to be the Blips' rival gang, the Cruds, whose jerseys have the red on the left and blue on the right. They are mistaken though, as what they've actually encountered is the reflection of a gang of Blips in a traffic intersection mirror. After a tense encounter with both gangs, it turns out that the Cruds are sending the weapons to the Blips as a peace offering with which both gangs can fight their common enemy: giant spiders. When they attempt to test the gift, each gang exterminates itself because of Bender's efforts to disable the weapons. Fry and Leela return to the ship to discover that Bender has been &quot;bot-jacked,&quot; leaving only his eyes, mouth and cigar in a nearby trash can.\n\nLuckily, back at Planet Express, Hermes reveals that Bender had a Ro-Jack installed and his parts will be traceable. The Ro-Jack is traced to [[Yuri]] 's chop-shop in Filthytown, and [[URL]] and [[Smitty]] lead a raid which yields Bender's head.  As he's being taken to jail, Yuri agrees to give up a list of buyers for Bender's parts and a giant robot head for URL in exchange for his freedom.\n\nFry, Leela and Bender proceed to scour the universe for Bender's missing parts.  His antenna (or &quot;Robo-dong&quot;) is traced to The Beast With Two Bucks Sex Shoppe, where with the aid of a photo taken by a secret toilet camera they discover it was sold to [[Hedonismbot]].  Bender's arms were purchased by the[[Borax Kid]] and are recovered on the Feldspar Queen gambling boat.  His chest was found in the ERR frat house at Mars University, and his legs were recovered from a hospital where they'd recently been transplanted to [[Tinny Tim]].  All this leaves is Bender's shiney metal ass.\n\nThe crew traces the ass to the wreck of the Floatwell, which crashed in the Sargaseous Sea.  On their approach to the location, they run aground near a lighthouse run by [[Tarquin]].  He offers his help in locating the wreck for a cut of the booty.\n\nIn a scene that is unclear as to whether it takes place in deep space, under water or some combination of the two, Bender, Fry and Leela find the wreckage of the Floatwell and locate Bender's butt.  They return to the lighthouse, and in celebration, Fry takes pictures of Bender biting his own shiney metal ass.  The flash from his camera reflected off of the ass proves brighter than the lighthouse's mirror/lamp assembly, which Tarquin asserts is already the brightest object in the known universe, and this results in the salvation of a ship which was about to run aground.  Tarquin, Fry and Leela pursuade Bender to leave the ass behind in the lighthouse in order to save the lives of sailors and their legacy of swearing.\n\nThis is not to the liking of the ass though.  As Tarquin begins reading passages from the Bible to the spinning ass, it apparently of its own accord spins off its axis and flys off into space.  It manages to save a child named Johnny who has fallen down a gravity well on his space farm, and returns to a grieving Bender at Planet Express amid a flourish of fireworks in the sky which, on inspection, actually turn out to be the spectacular crashes of several ships in the murky Sargaseous Sea.\n\n{{Stub}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season Ten]]"

Of the finalist the winner was Miss Vega 4, Gladdys Lennox - a Paramecia, and [[Zapp Brannigan]] sang the [[Miss Universe Song]] for her.

Leela is not too thrilled with the idea and gets the ship towed for being unsafe. The Professor manages to save the ship and join a street race gang while Leela gets a new ship that's completely safe.\n\n==Plot ==\nWhen Professor Farnsworth turbocharges the Planet Express Ship and names it Bessy, something goes horribly wrong and the crew crash lands in the launch bay after a stall out.  When the crew has the ship towed to the salvage yard, Hubert breaks in and upgrades the ship with parts from the scrap heap.  \n\nOn leaving the yard, Farnsworth is accosted by two cars of street-racing hoodlums and challenges them to a race around central park, the loser of which is to make the winner's Medicare Co-payments for a year. The Professor manages to win the race and evade the police by engaging his &quot;dimensional drift.&quot; Later, meeting up with the hoodlums, he is invited to join their crew. They are apparently lead by [[Benny]] , who is romantically attached to [[Minx]], an attractive young female gang member who keeps alluding to &quot;unspoken verbal abuse&quot; by her father. (Two other members of the gang do not have their names used in this episode.)\n\nMeanwhile at Planet Express, Leela has obtained a new safer, almost featureless delivery vehicle. They break in  the vehicle with a delivery to Glorianimus 3, a planet orbiting a fabulous rainbow giant star which unfortunately can't be seen during the delivery due to the fact that the new ship has no windshield. In fact, the new ship seems to take all the adventure out of the deliveries, and the crew is surprised to find themselves back in the launch bay with the ship having made the delivery automatically. The crew becomes listless, waiting in the ready room, so Hermes sends them on a grocery run and has Leela drop Fry and Bender off at their Karate class.\n\nReturning from her boring errands, Leela collides with a stop sign and finds herself accosted by the Professor and his new crew in much the way the Professor met the new crew. She challenges him to a drag race, which is to take place on a Moebiüs Drag Strip (&quot;Once around both same sides of the half twist, and back to the start and finish line.&quot;) After a race sequence in which the professor again engages the dimensional drift, the two vehicles suffer a head-on collision in which Fry is caught between the two vehicles. Again, Hermes has to call the tow truck.\n\nMeanwhile, Fry, Hubert, Leela and Bender (who was taking a nap in Leela's ship) find themselves in a two-dimensional realm called &quot;Flatbush.&quot;  Here they are taken to a feast in  their honor by the king of Flatbush, but they discover that they can't eat because their two-ended digestive system would divide a 2 dimensional being into separate pieces.  When Farnsworth determines that they need to return to the 3rd dimension or starve to death, the creatures of Flatbush become offended and the Planet Express crew has to escape.  They make it to the original Planet Express ship and theorize that if the dimensional drift feature let them go through the 4th dimension when the ship was 3D, engaging it as a 2D ship might return them to the third dimension. During their attempt, the Professor notes that the number of dimensions they occupy is growing continuously (&quot;two point one dimensions... two point two... two point pi&quot;) and the ship is seen surrounded by fractals.\n\nMeanwhile, at the scrap heap, the remaining Planet Express employees and the street racing crew watch as the flattened remains of the two ships are about to be incinerated.  As the blast furnace engages, the disk of scrap metal begins to bubble out, and the Planet Express Ship rematerializes in the third dimension.\n\nFinally, as everyone is celebrating, Minx receives a call from her father, and gives everyone a thumbs up.\n\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Season 7]]"

Winning the election, he caused a time paradox(Because Nixon did not win the election, the robot uprising never happened and Travers was never sent back in time.) that prevented him from coming to the year 3012,\n\n== Biography ==\n\nChris Travers was born on September 29, 3012 at Our Lady of Patriotism Hospital in Kenya. He grew up in a period of despair on Earth, when hunger and despair ravaged society. When the robot uprising took place, Travers was one of few humans who survived and took refuge underground. When he was 15, he was entrusted with mankind's last remaining suit and tie. He was [[time travel|sent back in time]] to stop the uprising from happening. He was raised by his grandparents and got into Harvard Law School, achieving straight A grades. He eventually became a community organizer and a Hawaiian senator before finally setting out to fulfill his true purpose: to defeat Richard Nixon's head in the Earth presidential election,3012 Earth presidential elections. Though his good-hearted views were shunned by the people and his campaign started to falter, Leela helped him reinvigorate his campaign. He was finally named a nominee, but was ravaged by accusations that he was not born on Earth. When Leela, Bender and Fry only did not find an Earth certificate in his file at Our Lady of Patriotism Hospital, Travers was forced to reveal his origins. Leela then planned to broadcast Travers' birth, set for the next day, on live television to counter allegations that he was not from Earth. With these accusations gone, Travers won the election. As he began to give his speech, however, he began to fade away. Since Nixon did not win the election, the robot uprising never happened and Travers was never sent back in time. All traces of Travers' campaign disappeared and Nixon was declared the winner of the election.\n\n==Trivia==\n\n* Travers has the same birthday as ''Futurama'' writer and director Patric M. Verrone, who wrote Decision 3012."

At the end of the commercial, Lrrr's son Jrrr appears and asks him to help him earn merit badges for his boy scouts.  Lrrr initially and selfishly refuses until Ndnd nags him into helping his son.  Lrrr and Jrrr then flip through the scout handbook to decide on which badges needed to be claimed but Jrrr is less interested in the badges involving acts of violence and prefers skull arranging, which Lrrr calls &quot;girly&quot; and flips the book to planetary invasion and decides to force his son to invade earth, which is what he calls &quot;the easiest planet to invade'. Meanwhile, The Professor announces that he's in terrible pain because of his arthritis. He tells the crew that he ran out of his medication which explains his arthritis pain. Lrrr then takes his son to Earth and drops him off at the White House with Nixon's head and his headless clone of Agnew answering the door.  Jrrr tries to make the traditional omicronial invasion address but messes it up and his father loses patience with it,Zapp Branigan and Nixon are both forced to sign a document that makes Jrrr the ruler of Earth.Lrrr begins telling Jrrr to shoot something so Jrrr could earn his badge and go back home so Lrrr can go home to catch the Finder Outer. Jrrr tries to find something to shoot at but he accidentally pulls the trigger while in the midst of deciding what to shoot and the laser hits and disentegrates Agnew, enraging Nixon.\n\nLrrr see's on TV  Nixon's address which he learns that all ties with Omicron Persei 8 will be cut including all TV Channels being broadcasted to Omicron Persei 8. The Planet Express team see's Nixon's address and are relieved they don't have to go to Omicron Persei 8 any more.The Professor then announces that the crew must get an important ingredient for his medicine, which is a herb that only grows on Omicron Persei 8. Hermes refuses to get the team to Omicron Persei 8, but after discovering the ingredient is actually Omicronian Marijuana. Immediately, Hermes joins the crew on the trip. The crew then go to that planet and easily get there by fooling Zapp Brannigan into thinking of the Planet Express ship as an Omicronian delivery ship by spraying Omicronian Express on the ship.  While on the planet, the crew is ordered to go into groups.  they all go out  to look for the herbs and they discover that the herb is bioluminesent when near Bender because of his electromagnetic feild.While looking for more of the herbs Fry gets distracted and wanders off from the Crew.  The crew soon escapes the planet in fear of getting caught and accidently leave Fry behind.  Fry then attempts to make his way towards safety but ends up in the garden shed on Lrrr's palace.\n\nMeanwhile, Lrrr is still watching TV and Jrrr comes out and asks his father to play with him but is coldly shrugged off.  Jrrr then heads outside and notices something moving in the garden shed.  He leaves a trail of what is seemingly candy to lure Fry out of the shed and Fry falls for it, eating the candy before waking up Jrrr.  Both of them initially get scared of one another but calm down.  Jrrr then tells fry that the &quot;candy&quot; Fry was eating was his excrement, grossing out Fry at first but he still continues to eat it.  Jrrr then leads Fry into the palace and tells him of his struggles of getting along with his father, who he thinks of as a terrible and selfish father as well as an incompetent ruler.  Jrrr then shows Fry a weapon called a fleem, which Fry plays with, causing him to bring back memories of Bender, saddening him.  Meanwhile on Earth, Bender has trouble dealing with Fry not being around anymore.  Leela then knocks on the apartment door and Bender tries to cover up Fry's disappearance by using the  answering machine's message on it to make it seem like Fry was preoccupied with getting drunk.  \n\nFry and Jrrr try to figure out how to get Fry home with Jrrr mentioning that the phone line connecting Omicron Persei 8 with Earth being cut off due to orders from Nixon.  They go by flying bicycle to a junkyard where they use the junk there to form the SOS message.Meanwhile,Bender has been using the answering machine to make it seem as if Fry has been with them but has been so busy, people barley seen him. Bender is trying to drink away his guilt of leaving Fry behind on the balcony that night and he then breaks the bottle only for him to zoom in and see the SOS message Fry wrote.Bender then steals the Planet Express Ship and flys to Omicron Persei 8 to rescue Fry. Meanwhile, Fry and Jrrr go back to the palace to play more games but Lrrr comes into the room and finds Fry hiding in Jrrr's closet.  He brings Fry outside in a cage and decides to force Jrrr to shoot Fry. Lrrr notices that Fry looks as if he is ill and orders Jrrr to kill him.  However, Jrrr shoots the cage instead, allowing Fry to escape.  Jrrr takes Fry to a nearby doctor with Lrrr and his soldiers chasing after them but they lose them.  At the doctors, Fry becomes increasingly ill, Drrr the doctor explained Fry is being poisoned from eating the excrement Jrrr drops and instead of saving him with the antidote, decides to put Fry down.Lrrr comes in and shoots Drrr's arm off.  He then orders Jrrr to kill Fry but Jrrr angirly refuses, saying that he will never be like his father. Lrrr is surprised at this and says that he is proud of Jrrr because he proved his manhood by standing up to his own father and says that he will kill Fry for Jrrr. However, Drrr announces that Fry is dead, which causes Jrrr to become very upset and start crying. Jrrr and Lrrr reconcile and finally bond.  Fry is discovered to be alive but with a glowing light in his butt because he ate some of the herbs which turn out to be bioluminescent. Bender arrives with the ship and enters the room to get Fry.Fry wakes up decides to leave with Bender. However, Jrrr wishes for Fry to stay so they could always hang out and grow up together, but Fry explains he needs to grow up on his own. Jrrr's butt soon starts glowing as well and becomes overjoyed by the light symbolizing his friendship with Fry.  Fry then goes back to Planet Express where no one knew that he was gone because of Bender's constant use of the answering machine. Leela comes up to Fry talking about their makeout session in a dark closet and how he was &quot;like a machine&quot; Bender then uses the answering machine to make it say &quot;I love you.

They end up going to a reserve where they are completely alone. Meanwhile, Amy, Bender, as well as Zoidberg make a delivery on a planet inhabitied by primates, including [[Guenter]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a succesful day of work with no injuries except [[Zoidberg]]  in the locker room, the Planet Express crew say goodbye to each other and goes back to their own places except the [[Professor Farnsworth|Professor]] who has no idea where's he going for the night. When everyone has left the building, Fry and Leela leave their locker where they've been hiding for a private evening while everyone was leaving. Fry then reveals his plans to Leela: a romantic dinner on the [[Planet Express Ship]] prepared with all kind of materials and foods found in the office. When they where about to share a kiss, they realise that [[Scruffy]] is still here mopping the floor.\n\nLooking for a private time, they decide to take a walk on Central Park where they are the only couple. However, they meet Bender, who tries to rob their wallets. Leela stuns Bender as she run away from him, with Fry collecting stolen wallets and purses stolen by Bender in the process.\n\nThey then go for a romantic dinner at Elzar [[Elzar's Fine Cuisine|restaurant]] where they are disrupted by Zoidberg who works there as dishwasher because [[Hermes]] doesn't pay him. Leela then decides that they should go to her apartment.\n\nWhile the two begin to kiss at her apartment, [[Nibbler]] watches them with one of his eye and they suddently stop. After Leela complains that it is impossible for them to be together with no one arroud, a targeting ad pops up from Leela's arm device promoting the [[Casa Isalada eco-resort]], a resort designed for couple. Fry thinks that Leela can't afford to pay the trip, but the ad says that she can have a 25% discount for being a return guest. Leela then reveals that she once went there with her ex-boyfriend [[Sean]]. The two agreed to go there as Leela won't exclusively thinks of Sean.\n\nThe next day, the rest of the crew is loading the Planet Express ship with tiny cars for a delivery on Simian 7, a planet exclusively inhabited with apes and where humans are not allowed. Fry and Leela arrive at Planet Express and say that they are going on vacation. The Professor initialy refuses their vacation, but agrees when he realises that they are human-being. He then chooses Zoidberg as Fry's substitute and [[Amy]] for Leela's substitute. However, since she's a human, she must wear her marmoset-like pajamas as a disguise.\n\nFry and Leela then arrive at their resort where they are well served by mechanical arms who can do anything they want including nose picking. After some activities and a supper, they go for a naked swim on a pound with all the surrounding fireflies. They decide to play Marco Polo, but Sean appears, undress himself and joins them on the pound much to Fry's disgust. Altough that the resort is only for two persons, Sean says that their shuttle is broken and that he must wait here until it is fixed by the mechanical arms. Leela then decides to go talk with Sean while Fry will waits them while feedind the mosquitoes.\n\nMeanwhile, Amy, [[Bender]] and Zoidberg arrive at Simian 7. After completing the delivery of the cars, the CEO of Bonobo and Associates (who's a gorilla) appears and say that they only want the tires for their new chairs. A vast group of apes appears and hapilly take all the tires from the cars. After Amy signs papers with a mandrill who is attracted to her upright posture, she then meets Guenter, who recognize her and promise to not say anything about her costume.\n\nBack on the resort, Leela and Sean are disussing about what happenned after they broke up. Sean reveals that his musical career made it to another step when he recorded a demo and a video until he lost his phone. Leela then reveals that she is not an alien, but a sewer mutant. Sean then start playing his saxophone, which Leela appreciate just like when she was dating him, but becomes bored after awhile. Meanwhile, Fry is watching them while drinking cocktails prepared by the mechanical arms. Since the mechanicals arms can't go out with Fry, he decides to fight Sean, but breaks his saxophone reed. An angry Sean who wants a money to fix his reed is about to beat up Fry when Sean's wife, [[Darlene]], appears and says that the shuttle is fixed. Sean and Darlene leave the resort while Leela watch's a drunk Fry eating peanut butter.\n\nBack on Simian 7, Guenter make a tour of his planet to Bender, Amy and Zoidberg. He reveals that Simian 7 was founded by Christopher Colobus to make a world where apes don't have to be specimen for humans experiments, organ grinders or being force to drive tiny vehicules. They then go to all-you-can-eat buffet buffet where they pick and eat bugs on living monkeys. Guenter then take the crew to an art gallery which displays monkeys art, litterature and music. They then go to a zoo where animals are on fence-free enclosure, but held in captivity with giant domes made out of glass.\n\nAt the same time, a sad Leela sits on the resort bed. Fry then comes in to apologize for ruining their vacation, but Leela blames Sean and says that she has no emotions for him. Finally together, they start to kiss much to Amy, Bender and Zoidberg's disgust who watch them as they are in the Simian 7 zoo enclosure for the Human specy. Noticing that the fireflies are all arround (which is in fact the flashes from visitors camera) they start to make love.\n\nTo save them from humiliation, Amy, Bender, Zoidberg and Guenter visit the zoo director which is in fact [[Dr. Banjo]]. Bender argues they can't keep Fry and Leela against their will, but Dr. Banjo says that they paid for their vacation and that it is fair to put humans on display just like humans put apes on display. He also trys to discourage them fromm saving Leela and Fry by showing them some clips of Leela and Fry talking behind their back. Those clips reveals to Dr. Banjo that Amy is in fact a human. After Dr. Banjo attempt to tranquilize Amy with a jet injector, they run away from Dr. Banjo except Guenter, who was hit.\n\nTrying to save Leela and Fry despite their comments, Amy, Bender and Zoidberg are trapped into several animal enclosures. When they finally reach the human habitat, they are swallowed by a giant [[Moon Worm|moon worm]]. After 1 week being trapped in the moon worm, they are thrown out of it and manage to get into the human habitat. However, as they enter into it, Fry and Leela are already leaving in their shuttle.\n\nAs everyone is back to Planet Express, Fry and Leela tell what they did in the resort. Bender wants to tell them the truth, but Amy says that he should not because it would make them feel bad. As Leela notices Amy pajamas is all torn apart, she and Fry irronically talk about the comments they made on Amy, Bender and Zoidberg in the resort which make them more upset. Bender finally yells: ''You were in a Zoo!''.\n[[Category:Season Ten]]"

In this episode the gang (with Hermes as Freddie, Amy as Velma, Leela as Daphne, Fry as Shaggy and Bender as Scooby/Bendee) are driving through the Repeating Forrest (a reference to the low-rent animation tactics used by Hanna-Barberra) on their way to visit the Professor's Cloning lab. On the way, they are first accosted by a Dragon Ghost which warns them to leave the forrest, and subsequently they stop at [[George Takei]]'s kabuki theater (which has fallen on hard times due to the placement of a basketball arena next door) for a bite to eat. Making their way on to the cloning lab, where [[Zoidberg]] is the Professor's anti-cloning butler and the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] are visiting in order to have a team of 5 clones of [[Larry Bird]] made in order to practice against.  While staying overnight, nearly every Scooby Doo trope is paid homage to, culminating in a two-part reveal which results in the decapitation of Zoidberg (as though the Mystery Crew expected his real head to be a removable mask) and Takei's admission of his being behind the Dragon Ghost as a result of mental illness.  The Trotters go on to their scheduled local basketball game, which turns out to be against a team of SIX Larry Birds.\n\nThe crowd outside the White House grows violent and throws a brick through the window. Nixon's solution is to watch Purpleberry Pond-after putting in a call to Hollywood that the public want the government to regulate children's programming to have helpful lessons shoehorned in. In Purpleberry Pond, life is idyllic and everyone and everything are a shade of violet. The characters encourage &quot;healthy&quot; eating, having fun with others, and not judging people because they're different. Throughout there are commercials for Purpleberry Puffs cereal, a new variety of cereal being introduced whenever a new character is introduced, with a sub-narrative wherein the child in the commercials becomes obese and is implied to have developed Type II diabetes. For example, when &quot;Lord Loquat&quot; is introduced, &quot;orange berry&quot; pieces are added to the cereal, and when the Berry Burglar (Professor Farnsworth in a role analogous more to Gargamel from the Smurfs rather the Purple Pie Man from Strawberry Shortcake) fires a sugarball bomb at Purpleberry Pond, the cereal introduces its new &quot;Sugar-blasted&quot; pops.\n\nLastly, Nixon and Agnew begin to watch the G.I. Zapp cartoon, but find after a few minutes that it is, as the rioting crowd outside says, too violent.  Nixon creatively re-edits the cartoon (using a device which is implied to have played a part in Nixon's historical erasing of Oval Office tapes.)  In Nixon's version, the violently code-named GI Zapp members are re-christened, more innocent explanations for violent actions are narrated in Nixon's voice (e.g., a version of water-boarding is made bobbing for apples and footage is run backwards to create &quot;bullet sucking tanks.&quot;)  When &quot;Orphan Crusher's&quot; (Bender's) chest cavity opens to reveal what appears to be a giant Killamajig from Chapek 9 or a Fleen from Omicron Persei 8, set to violently dispatch of an enemy soldier, Nixon gives up and cuts to a GI Joe style PSA about sharing instead of fighting featuring [[Dwight]], [[Cubert]] and Nixon and Agnew themselves, riding up on a motorcycle and sidecar and tearing in half the football that the children had just been arguing over, culminating in a rainbow-against-a-starscape catchphrase, &quot;Now you know something!&quot;\n\n{{Stub}}\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}"

After he discovers he was replaced on All My Circuts with Vaxatron, Calculon stars in his own one-man show.\n\n==Summary==\nThe episode starts with Morbo and Linda's show &quot;Earth's Celebrity and Invasions&quot; After Morbo does an interview with the General from his home planet, Linda is shown at the burial site of Calculon, where fans came to mourn the loss of Calculon. Linda interviews Fry and Bender, the latter of whom explains that ''All My Circuits'' hasn't been good since Calculon died. After the interview, they rush home to watch a new ''All My Circuits'', only to complain about the new main character, [[Vaxtron]]. Fry begins to wish that they could bring Calculon back to life, which the Professor replies is possible. The Professor explains that since Calculon was a robot, they can reboot his system into his original body through science. First, they need Calculon's body, which Bender promptly grave-robs. Then, the Professor explains they now need Calculon's soul, which was in Limbo because he committed suicide, meaning they would have to venture to Robot Hell to retrieve it.\n\nMeanwhile, in Robot Hell, Calculon is expressing his sadness of not being alive, much to the Robot Devil's annoyance. Just then, Fry and Bender arrive planning to reclaim a soul. The Robot Devil refuses, but promptly changes his mind after learning the soul is that of Calculon. Fry challenges the Robot Devil for Calculon's soul. If he wins, he wins the soul; if he loses, The Robot Devil gets to kill them. Soon, Fry wins the challenge, although he guessed wrong (he had to guess what number the Robot Devil was thinking, which was between 1 and 3) - the Robot Devil hands over Calculon's soul and tells them to leave.\n\nBack at Planet Express, the Professor and the Planet Express team get ready to bring Calculon back with &quot;science&quot;(it was a satanic ritual) First, everyone put their protective cloaks on, then placed five wireless networks around Calculon's body (it created a satanic star), Amy then played Calculon's installation disc backwords (it began to say, &quot;rise from the Dead in the name of Satan&quot;) while the professor sacrificed a mechanical goat for it's main hard-drive and installed it into one of the wireless networks which sent a electric pulse into Calculon's body and returned his soul to his body. Calculon woke up in a woozy state, once he snapped out of it, he was thrilled to be alive again. The Planet Express team expressed joy and the Professor screamed &quot;Hail Science!&quot; (to which his hood fell off showing the number 666 on his forhead).\n\nThe next day Fry, Leela, Bender and Calculon all watch the new episode of All My Circuits to which Calculon shows disgust of the fact they replaced him with Vaxatron. They all fly to Hollywood to get Calculon's job back. They meet with the execubots and learn that Calculon cannot return to his job on All My Circuits because his acting style is outdated. Back at Planet Express, they watch on tv and learn that Calculon's star on the walk of fame has been removed and replaced with a second star for [[Robert Wagner's head]]. Depressed, Calculon decides to try the one man play he created many years ago but never got around to performing. Soon enough, everyone is at Calculon's performance of his play. After the first night; Fry, Leela and Bender take Calculon out to celebrate and learn that the play received horrible reviews and twelve people are hospitalized from boredom. Even more depressed, Calculon began to blame Fry, Bender and Leela for bringing him back and promised to never act again.\n\nThe following morning, Calculon began to pack his things and prepare to leave for good. Leela, noticing how depressed he truly was, believed that after being knocked down so many times actually showed his true acting talent. Leela tells Calculon to audition for a small role on All My Circuits in disguise. They all go to the All My Circuits adutions to which Calculon receives his old role (althogh they didn't know it was him, they gave him the role because he looks like he could act badly enough to be Calculon) At the set, Calculon remorses on how he use to feel like the king when he was on set. But after several minutes, he returns to his old ways. During his big scene with Monique, Calculon complains about the script to which the Director cuts the scene. He threatens Calculon that he has one more chance or he's fired. Calculon, not use to taking a second takes began to scream on how he was the star and doesn't do second takes. Leela, getting annoyed with his attitude began to tell Calculon how he was always a lousy actor, that no one missed him when he died and that he was better off dead to begin with. She also mentions that his acting days were over and he should give up. Being told this, Calculon began to feel depressed. When re-doing the scene, Calculon's acting was more believeable to the point where some began to cry. After being asked who he was by the Director, Calculon removes his disguise shocking everyone except the Planet Express team. Everyone threw a round of applause to Calculon and asked him to take a bow. Calculon, now a little more humble felt he didn't deserve it. Leela insisited to him to take the bow which he did. Unfortunately, the noose he hung in the scene fell and some stage lights crashed. Calculon shocked at the surprise was a little bit more relieved that it didn't kill him. Before he knew it, the entire walkway landed on him, killing him once again.\n\n\n\nThe folowing day after his passing, The Mayor officially puts Calculon's star back on the walk of fame feeling Calculon deserves it. The Robot Devil and Calculon's spirit were watching as Calculon's star went back on the walk of fame and Calculon began to feel loved. The Robot Devil, annoyed with Calculon returning, turns the TV off. Calculon then offers to perform his one man play for everyone in Robot Hell. To which the Robot Devil screams &quot;Haven't they suffered enough?!&quot;\n\n{{Stub}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Inside is a mechanical [[buggalo]]. Bender rides it first, declaring that he will set a new record or &quot;eat his hat&quot; -- he succeeds by setting a new ''lowest ''record of 0.4 seconds. [[Zoidberg]] eats the hat anyway. \n\nWhen [[Leela]] takes her turn, she is thrown off but unable to let go, causing her to thrash about. The off switch also malfunctions, and the mechanical buggalo apparently achieves consciousness. Moments before it crushes a little girl, one of the bar patrons shoot it. Even still, Leela can't let go. Zoidberg inspects her hand and notices her hand has broken out in suction cups. \n\nThe Planet Express crew take her to see [[Doctor Tenderman]] who reveals that she is infected with [[Squidification]], a genetic disease that sometimes affects mutants, and that it is incurable, dooming her to be turned into a slithering mass of tentacles. The doctor reveals that the only treatment is an &quot;incredibly expensive&quot; procedure that only slows the process. [[Fry]] declares that no matter what, he will continue to love her. \n\nLeela visits her parents and they tell her she's free to move in with them. \n\nAt Planet Express, Fry decides that he will do anything he can to raise the money for Leela's surgery. [[Professor Farnsworth]] agrees and tells Fry to sell [[Old Bessie]] (the Planet Express Ship) for funds. Fry takes the ship to [[Parts 'N' Crafts]] where he finds a street peddler who scams Fry by selling him &quot;magic beans&quot; that &quot;fell from the sky&quot; in exchange for the ship. When Fry returns with them, Farnsworth slaps them out of his hand and through a window, where outside they begin to grow into a massive beanstalk. \n\nRealizing that her squidification is rapidly occuring, Leela decides to move to the sewers. She packs up her things and leaves a note for the Planet Express crew to find, but as she leaves the building she finds the massive beanstalk that stretches up to the clouds. Figuring she has nothing to lose, she climbs it instead of descending to the sewers. \n\nThe beanstalk collapses and Leela grabs onto a cloud, finding a luxury castle in the clouds, discovering that it is populated by unicorns and other fantastical animals. Just when she thinks her luck has turned around, she's captured by [[Walt]], [[Larry]] and [[Igner]]. \n\nShe's brought to [[Mom]], who reveals that the castle is [[Momsanto]], a legal loophole that allows [[MomCorp]] to conduct genetic modifications. Leela originally does not approve of this but changes her views when Mom tells Leela she can change her DNA to cure the Squidification.   \n\n{{Stub}}\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]\n[[Category:Mom Episodes]]"

The ship soon goes to Earth and broadcasts the same tone across the planet, which Professor Farnsworth believes is an attempt to communicate. Fry, on the other hand, remarks that the music sounds familiar. The Professor analyzes his brain as they hear the music and determines that Fry had heard it on December 31st, 1999, the day he got frozen and came to the future. Nibbler says he was also there that day to ensure that Fry would be frozen but recalls no such music.\n\nWith two weeks before the spaceship arrives, Fry is set up is a contraption so he can relive his last day in the past and find the source of the music. Upon waking in his old apartment, he remarks on all his old stuff, including his then-girlfriend [[Michelle]], who takes offense at being called old. Fry then figures that he wouldn't be cheating on Leela by sleeping with dream-Michelle, but Leela orders him to get going. Fry then walks around Old New York City, trying to figure out where he heard the music, even consulting his old break dancing gang. He then decides to go into the nearby strip club, having never been in there before, only to find the inside to be full of white nothingness. Farnsworth reminds him that he never went into the club, so he can't remember the inside. A defeated Fry walks and recalls that at this point he was nearly run over by an ice cream truck, which it nearly does.\n\nFry then wakes up, only to learn that he was asleep for thirteen and a half days. The UFO has gotten closer and Earth is shaking from the repetition of the deafening music. Fry is then put back into his dream, despite his protests that it was the worst day of his life. But upon arriving at his old family home and embracing [[Seymour Asses|Seymour]], he realizes that he only hated his old life because he never got to see his family. Instead of looking for the melody, he decides to spend his remaining time on Earth with his family, or at least his mind's representation of them. But as they get to the point where Fry has to go to his pizza delivery job and thereby go to the future, Fry refuses to go and tries to tell his mother that she will never see him again. But his crewmates enter his dream, along with President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] and Vice-President [[Agnew]], to remind him of his mission. Fry's father acknowledges Nixon as their &quot;country's greatest president&quot;. Nixon tells Mr. Fry that he requires his son for a &quot;far out musical quest&quot;. Everyone then drags Fry out the door and despite his attempts to get in and talk to his mother, Farnsworth reminds him that he never came back home after 10:00 PM, as Fry finds it another blank memory.\n\nConsenting to finding the music once more, Fry takes everyone back through the last hours of his 20th century life. Reaching the part where he says farewell to Seymour, he realizes that his dog can simply shrink down and hop into his pocket. Everyone then follows him on rickshaw cart pulled by Zoidberg. Then meeting Michelle dumping him for another man, Leela gets insulted and shouts that only she gets to dump Fry.\n\nArriving at [[Applied Cryogenics]], as Fry falls into the cryogenic tube, he hears the music. Everyone then wakes up in the real world, Fry explaining that there also additional notes in the music. They then go to Mount Shushmore, where Fry plays the extra notes, which the UFO acknowledges and lands, (this seen is modeled after the landing scene in the movie: Close Encounters of the Third Kind)\nrevealing that it's actually very small and piloted by a [[Nibblonian]], whom Nibbler identifies as [[Digby]]. When everyone asks why Digby was doing, he insists that destroying Earth was not his goal. He asks Nibbler if he remembers. When it appears that he doesn't, Digby explains that over a thousand years ago, he was Nibbler's chauffeur, transporting him to Earth so he could freeze Fry. Just as he knocked Fry into the cryo tube, Digby then remembered he forgot to lock their spaceship and used the remote control to do so, the control's ringtone being heard by Fry. Nibbler and Digby then went out and celebrated at O'Grady's Pub, where they got drunk and accidentally lost the keys to their ship in a storm drain. This sparks Nibbler's memory, as he says that they had to take a cab to their base on [[Vergon 6]]. Digby finishes that his boss gave him a new spaceship and keys and went throughout the universe in search of his lost ship, but was unaware of how loud his new remote's ringtone was. Fry then brings everyone to the rooftop of Applied Cryogenics, where the ruined Nibblonian spaceship is waiting. After recharging the engine with Bender as a makeshift charger, Digby flies off. Nibbler thanks Fry for assisting the Nibblonian people once more and promises to repay him, though Fry doubts it.\n\nFry then dreams arriving home and finding his mother watching a football game. But then he realizes that the game she's watching happened after he was frozen and becomes confused. Nibbler appears and explains that Fry is experiencing his mother's dream back in the past, as a means of repaying his debt. Fry then expresses his love for his mother with a hug. In the past, Mrs. Fry wakes up and smiles at a picture of her youngest son.\n\n{{Stub}}\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n[[Category:Season Ten]]\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

[[Fry]] and [[Leela]] are walking down the street when the mascot, &quot;Craterface&quot; (seen in episode two of season one) is making balloon animals and Fry buys Leela a balloon of herself. [[Bender]] is so excited that he cartwheels the way to Luna Park. The crew then boards the Mecha-Hexadecapus which Bender breaks by barfing up nuts and bolts (because he kept cartwheeling and jumping) which sends Leela flying through the park's glass protective bubble and into space. (The hole is sealed when Craterface is sucked into it by depressurization.) The Moon Patrol only finds her stuffed Buggalo, thinking her dead, but Fry discovers Leela had sheltered herself inside the plush while breathing the air from inside her balloon double. Later, at their apartment, Fry confesses to Bender that after that near-death accident, he decides he's going to propose to Leela.\n\nThe next day, the Professor shows off his latest invention: the Time Button. With it, he send the entire universe ten seconds into the past. Only the user(s) of the button or those hiding in an anti-chroniton-resistant-grout coated &quot;Time Shelter&quot; can recall what happened. As the crew gets in the shelter to watch, Zoidberg comes in to boast that he got a ten-dollar bill from a guy leaving in a taxi. Farnsworth then takes the bill before using the button and everyone takes glee in Zoidberg's disappointment when he finds no money in his pocket. Leela asks if he can use the button to go back as far as she wants by pressing it over and over again. He claims that's impossible, as it takes ten seconds for the button to recharge. Fry then asks him if using the button can make a moment last forever. The Professor takes offense, stating that the button is to be only used for scientific purposes, as he pushes it again to watch Zoidberg's misery.\n\nHowever, Fry steals the button so he and Bender can steal diamonds from &quot;Ultra Guy's Custom Diamonds&quot; (without the proprietor knowing about it) to create a golfball-size engagement ring. He then prepares his proposal to Leela at Elzar's. Unfortunately, the giant clam carrying her diamond ring bites off her right hand. Fry panics, but then uses the button to prevent this. However, he doesn't want to hear Leela agree to his proposal until she can accept it at the Vampire State Building at 6:00pm, where he can make the sunset last as long as she wants. As he waits for her arrive, she is apparently tardy. At 7:02pm, he decides that Leela has rejected him. He decides to commit suicide by jumping off the building. As he falls, he spots Leela arriving. Due to his repeated use of the time button, his watch was over an hour ahead of the rest of the universe. He then tries to use the button to return to a point in time before he'd jumped off the building, but discovers that he has been falling for more than 10 seconds, so that he can never return to the point before he jumps.\n\nBack at Planet Express, the Professor urges everyone to get into his anti-time shelter. With the button being used, the universe is in a constant time loop. Naturally, Bender is quick to rat Fry out. Unfortunately, they can't leave the shelter without causing a duplicate paradox. Their past selves will be caught in the loop while their present selves will be shredded across the time stream &quot;...like human coleslaw.&quot; The Professor demonstrates by throwing the dollar bill out as the button is being used. So they run to the Vampire State Building while carrying the shelter, stopping every ten seconds. When they arrive, Farnsworth accidentally distracts Fry, causing him to lose the button and hit the ground, dying on impact. Leela uses the button to undo this, but accidentally shreds the Professor since he had stepped out of the shelter unbeknownst to her. Fry then explains his predicament to Leela amidst a series of deaths. Realizing they need an exit strategy, Bender waits for an opportune moment and saves Fry's life with his airbag. But as Fry bounces off and everyone celebrates, he accidentally falls on the button and breaks it, causing time to freeze for everyone except Fry and Leela (literally making that moment &quot;last forever&quot; like Fry had forshadowed.)\n\nFry and Leela discover that they can still interact with objects to an extent (for example, they can still eat, but they can walk across the ocean to France, blow snowflakes out of the way and play frisbee) and with living things as though they were inanimate objects. They stage a wedding for themselves at St. Koch's Cathedral, the Space Pope silently and motionlessly presiding, as well as begin to explore planet Earth in a multi-decade honeymoon, all the while being pestered by a mysterious glimmer (&quot;If it keeps bugging us, we'll either kill it or adopt it,&quot; says Leela.)\n\nWhen they reach old age, they return to the Vampire State Building roof garden, where Fry recites his intended proposal, in which he again makes reference to making a moment last forever. Reflecting on their years in &quot;Frozen time,&quot; Leela repeats her salmon-self line &quot;It's been a good life&quot; from &quot;Naturama&quot; and reassures Fry that &quot;I was never lonely-not even for a minute.&quot;\n\nThen suddenly, the glimmer appears and turns into a tunnel, from which the Professor emerges. He explains that the button merely rotated him into &quot;...an orthogonal time that runs at right angles to...&quot; Fry and Leela's frame of reference. He's been tunneling for decades, searching every instant &quot;...from yesterday to tomorrow&quot; for the button. (&quot;We've been right now the whole time,&quot; exclaims Fry.) When Fry reveals he's been carrying the pieces of the broken button with him for years, having tried to repair it but getting angry and smashing it further, Farnsworth quickly repairs and modifies the device so that he can reset everything. However, he explains that it will now send the trio back to the moment before he invented the Time Button, leaving them with no memory of any event that took place afterward. Fry and Leela decide to give their life together another go and they share one last kiss before the button is pushed for the final time.\n\n\n{{EpisodeListProductionOrder}}\n{{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}\n[[Category:Episodes]]"

Since the [[Time Button]] operates for ten seconds at a time, this 38 minute difference means that Fry used the Time Button 228 times to make the arrangements to propose to Leela. (This assumes his watch was in sync with the clock on the building.) The last of the 228 times was to prevent her hand from being bitten off by the clam at the restaurant.\n*EASTER EGG: In the first scene of the episode, you can see that sunken cart in the crater in which that appeared in the second episode of season 1 as the Planet Express Ship heads for the parking lot.\n[[file:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|right|200px]]\n* The moon-headed, balloon sculptor is a tribute to the very first science fiction film, ''[[wikipedia:Voyage dans la Lune|Voyage dans la Lune]]'' (A Trip to the Moon) (1902).

The movie satirized the conservative science community of that decade and was made on a huge budget, for the time, of 10,000 Francs.  His gamble paid off as the film was very popular.  It is also known for being one of the earliest films pirated. \n\n[[Category:References]]"

    "text": "[[File:Vampire_State_Building.png|thumb|The upper portion of the Vampire State Building in 3013.]]\nThe '''Vampire State Building''' is the tallest building in [[New New York City]]. It has 240 floors plus a clock on the top.\n\nIn 3013, Fry rented the roof garden on top of the building, because he wanted the moment in which Leela would agree to marry him to be special. He asked her to be there at six thirty. However, as his watch was fast, he thought that she was not coming, so he jumped off. In actuality, though, she was on time, having arrived five minutes earlier. The two returned there many years later, after Fry accidentally froze the universe, and drank the champagne that a janitor — János — had poured when Fry rented the garden. They were then joined by the professor.\n\nThe height of the building isn't mentioned in the series, however, it can be estimated. Comparing the building to existing skyscrapers we could assume each floor takes on average 10-11ft which would mean the entire building measured about 2640ft, not including the top. Including the top it would likely be comparable to the currently tallest building, the Burj Khalifa measuring 2717ft.\n\nIn the Episode 'Meanwhile' Fry jumps of the roof of the Vampire State Building. In this scene the height of the building becomes somewhat unclear. While falling Fry realizes he can use the time button to transport him back 10 seconds in the past, which he hopes will save him. We see him activating the time button for the first time when he is about 15ft above the pavement. He is transported 10 seconds into the past and appears just beneath one of the statutes below the top. This means that in about 10 seconds he would fall from the top to the bottom of the tower. When we calculate the speed of a free-fall on earth this means the tower is about 1700-1800ft high from the bottom to the platform. Since air resistance and terminal velocity was ignored the fall would actually be even shorter. In this case the tallest building in New New York would be about the same hight as the current tallest building in Old New York, the 'One World Trade Center' measuring 1776ft. However when comparing the number of floors in both buildings ( 240 to 104) it seems unrealistic that both buildings would be equally tall. Meaning that either vampires are shorter than present day humans or that the time button isn't that precise and sends Fry more than 10 seconds back in time. Alternatively it could mean nothing because Futurama is a cartoon and doesn't have to comply with real world physics and anyone who thinks it does is a moron.\n\nIn the episode Fry jumps at 9.08min and activates the button at 9.38min. It is hard to compare the time in the episodes with real time but in this scene we could assume that both are equal. This means Fry would be falling for about 25 seconds after he hit the statue. When factoring in terminal velocity and air resistance this would make the height of the Vampire State Building a lot more reasonable compared whit its' number of floors.\n\n==Appearances==\n*[[Meanwhile]]\n[[Category:Buildings]]"

Later that night, Homer and Marge are in bed when they hear a strange noise in the house, so Homer and Bart go investigate. Homer uses Bart as bait and he finds [[Bender]] drinking his Duff Beer. Bender and Homer soon become friends. however, [http://the-simpsons-a.wikia.com/wiki/Lisa_Marie_Simpson bob] becomes suspicious about Bender being from the future as she says that &quot;Robotic technology today is very advanced!&quot; and a trip to Professor Frink's lab makes Bender reveal he came back in time to kill Homer. Bender's Shiny Metal Ass displays Leela asking Bender if he has killed Homer yet, and replies he is on it but he does not have the heart to kill his friend and bends his gun. Fry, Leela and Bender arrive at Springfield and team up with their Simpson Counterparts. Lisa, Professor Farnsworth and Professor Frink tell The Planet Express Crew and The Simpsons that as ooze had poured into the capsule mutating the items inside into Rabbits. Professor Farnsworth reveals that the DNA was half Homer, and Marge is the other half and need to kill her. However, Professor Frink says that they could kill Bart, and the creatures will cease to exist. Bender's ass shows a hologram of Amy Wong, saying that the creatures killed Scruffy. A second later, Scruffy walks in and says that life without his moustache (That the rabbits ripped off) is not worth living, and shoots himself. The Simpsons and the Planet Express crew arrive at the town square as Bender's ass shows a hologram of [[Linda van Schoonhoven]] and [[Morbo]], saying that the creatures have begun evolving. a few seconds later, a rabbit eats Linda and generates a cocoon-type blanket around itself. The Rabbit breaks out a few seconds later, having evolved into a green gollum-type animal resembling Bart Simpson. Bender sucks The Planet Express crew and The Simpsons through his chest, taking them to New New York. Marge realizes they left Maggie behind. In Town Square, Bender takes Maggie to the Springfield Downs to bet on Horses. In New New York, Bart and Lisa trick the Creatures into the Madison Cube Garden, and the Planet Express Ship lifts the building and hurls it into space. Fry and Homer finish building the portal and The Simpsons return to Springfield where Marge is reunited with Maggie. Homer asks how bender will get to the future, and bender replies, &quot;The Old Fashioned way.&quot;. Bender shuts himself down for 1000 years and Homer gives him one last can of Duff Beer.

    "title": "Fry's and Leela's relationship",
    "text": "Throughout the history of ''[[Futurama]]'', the relationship between [[Philip J. Fry]] and [[Turanga Leela]] has been an ongoing theme. From their initial meeting where Leela attempted to implant a [[Career chip]] in Fry after he emerged from cryogenic stasis, the relationship grew as they came to appreciate each other, culminating in the extended temporary marriage seen in the series finale &quot;[[Meanwhile]]&quot;.\n\n[[File:FryandLeela'swedding.jpg|thumb|306px|Fry and Leela's wedding]]\n{{Quote|You know, Fry? I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now.|Leela to Philip J. Fry}}\n{{Quote|Then I am the most important person in the universe.|Philip J. Fry in ''[[The Why of Fry]]''}}\n\n\nWhen Fry first met Leela, he seemed to have fallen in love with her, though she at first only considered him a &quot;kid from the stupid ages&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Space Pilot 3000]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; During the ''[[Titanic]]'' cruise, Leela claimed she was engaged to Fry to stop [[Zapp Brannigan]]'s unwanted advances and they kiss for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight&quot;&gt;&quot;[[A Flight to Remember]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the [[Omicronian]]s attacked Earth, a [[professional beach bully]] assumed that Leela was Fry's girlfriend and unsuccessfully tried to make $50 from Fry by pretending to steal her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Attack&quot;&gt;&quot;[[When Aliens Attack]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Fry often tells Leela she is beautiful and reminds her that she is perfect just the way she is.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Cyber House Rules]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When they are turned into teenagers by age-reducing tar, they go on at least one date.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn his first 31st century Xmas, Fry purchases a parrot as a gift for Leela.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xmas&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Xmas Story]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When Fry was infested with worms that made him stronger, more intelligent, as well as able to play the holophoner, he was able to impress Leela, but he convinced the worms to leave his body because he wanted to find out if Leela loved him or the worms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parasites&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Parasites Lost]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Fry later tried to learn how to play the holophoner without the worms by swapping hands with the [[Robot Devil]]. Fry performs an opera to effectively win Leela's affection again, only to be interrupted by the Robot Devil's scheme to reclaim his hands. Fry plays the finale of the opera privately at Leela's request.&lt;ref name=&quot;Playthings&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Fry even moved the stars themselves to express his love for Leela while time was skipping randomly. This convinced her to marry him, but she quickly divorced him, thinking he had tricked her into marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slippin'&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Time Keeps on Slippin']]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen the Planet Express crew were turned into teenagers, Fry and Leela went on at least one date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurdles&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When Fry traveled back in time after being trapped on the Infosphere, Nibbler made Fry realize that if there was one thing worth saving in the future, it was Leela. After Fry returned to Earth, Nibbler gave Fry a flower and blanked his memory. Not knowing why he has a flower, Fry assumes he picked it for Leela and gave it to her and Leela thanks him by kissing him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why of Fry&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Why of Fry]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen Leela was stung by a [[space bee]] and became comatose as a result, Fry stayed by Leela's side attempting to wake her. When she did wake up, Fry and Leela hugged each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sting&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Sting]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Fry even obtained the [[Robot Devil]]'s hands while he was trying to relearn how to play the holophoner to impress Leela. During this period, Fry wrote and started to perform an opera about Leela. When the Robot Devil took his hands back and Fry resumed playing the opera on the holophoner horribly, Leela was the only member of the audience that stayed because she wanted to hear how it ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Playthings&quot; /&gt;\n\nLeela met [[Lars Fillmore]] in ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'' and quickly fell in love with him. They planned to be married, but Lars called off the wedding mysteriously on the day of the ceremony, ending their relationship. He reveals near the end of the film that he always loved Leela and sacrifices himself to save Leela and Fry. Leela then discovers that Lars was really the older, maturer time duplicate of Fry, thus it was Fry she had been in love with.\n\nWhen the tear in the universe was caused,&lt;ref name=&quot;Billion Backs&quot;&gt;''[[The Beast With a Billion Backs]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Fry and [[Colleen]] were brought together by fear. After discovering [[]Colleen had four other boyfriends when Fry decided to move in with her, Fry broke up with Colleen. At the end of ''The Wild Green Yonder'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Wild Green&quot;&gt;''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Fry and Leela profess their love for each other and kiss as the Planet Express ship enters a wormhole.\n\nIn an alternate universe, Leela learns that she could be happily married to Fry if only she flipped the coin differently. But in this universe, she repeatedly rejected him by making up excuses such as having sweaty boot rash or having to meet a ghost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parabox&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs shown in Season 6 they made it through to the other side of the wormhole but headed towards a crash course towards Earth. Fry used his body to protect Leela and thus died in the accident. The Professor tried to use the Rebirth machine to bring him back to life but when that failed Leela built a Robot duplicate and uploaded Fry's personality into it. However the Robot short curcited and electrocuted Leela, putting her into an inreversible coma. As a result of the shock, both lost their short term memory of the time. When Robot Fry wakes up, he believes himself to be the real Fry. When he discovers Leela is in a coma he builds a robot duplicate of her and uploads her personality. Robot Leela finds out the truth about herself and breaks it off with Fry until she can decide whether her feelings are hers. Leela's living will states for her to be eaten by a special breed of Cyclopse eating animal, so the crew attended a funeral for her. When Bender's partying wakes Leela up she is furious that Fry built a Robot duplicate of her to replace her. However later Fry confesses to himself he only liked Robot Leela because she had so much of Leela in her. Leela overhears and forgives him. However Robot Leela is jealous and the two start fighting over him. Fry is accidently shot and is revealed as a robot. When the professor explains the turn of events, the real Fry is reborn through the Rebirth machine. The Robot Fry and Leela confess their love for each other and leave the crew, including a confused Fry and Leela.\n\nThroughout season 6 the two share more moments together though seem to have an on/off relationship as Leela states in &quot;[[That Darn Katz!]]&quot; that she wishes she had a man. In &quot;[[The Late Philip J. Fry]]&quot; Fry shows up late for his birthday date with Leela. He promises to take her to the Cavern on the Green for dinner that night to make it up to her. However, the Professor makes him test out his forward time machine for being late and thus Fry is sent to the year 10,000 along with Bender and the Professor.\n\nIn the year 3010, Leela is angry at Fry for ditching her, assuming he went to a bachelor party with Bender. When the news reports that everyone in the party died she remains mad at Fry but also is saddened by his death. In the year 3050 Leela is unhappily married to Cubert (she married him only because of his resemblance to Fry). Fry's birthday card lands on her head through the time paradox and Leela learns the truth of what happens to him. She goes to the Cavern on the Green and leaves a message for him stating 'Our time together was short but it was the best time of my life'. Fry discovers the message in the year 1,000,000,000 and decides to carry on to the end of the universe. When they discover that the universe runs on an infintie loop, the 3 forward to their time (the 2nd time round due to the Professor screwing up). The three reach their time, killing their 3rd version selves. Fry makes it to the restaurant in time for his date.\n\nIn &quot;[[The Prisoner of Benda]]&quot; Leela trades Amy for the Professor's body when she comes to beleive that Fry only loves her for her beauty. In order to beat Leela at her own game Fry switches bodies with Zoidberg in an attempt to repulse Leela. This leads them to one-up each other while doing various disgusting acts while on a date, which leads them to have sex in their equally disgusting bodies.\n* This is the first time in the series Fry and Leela have sex.\n\nIn &quot;[[Overclockwise]]&quot;, Leela and Fry begin to wonder about the big question: what will their future be if the two decide to get together after all? Leela left Planet Express to become a real estate agent. She returns towards the end of the episode, saying she always thought of Planet Express and memories of Fry. Bender then reveals that he printed out the answers to life's greatest questions, including what becomes of Leela and Fry. Once they read it and share facial expressions as well as slapping each other's face at least once, they smile and look at one another as the episode ends. While the contents remain unknown to the viewer, it seems clear that Fry and Leela's future together would be a wonderful one.\n\nIn &quot;[[Zapp Dingbat]],&quot; after convincing Leela that her mother and Zapp Brannigan are possibly &quot;meant to be,&quot; Fry conjectures that &quot;maybe Zapp isn't the only one who's marriage material.&quot; Leela respondes, &quot;you're getting there,&quot; and kisses him.\n\nIn &quot;[[Fun on a Bun]]&quot;, at Oktoberfest, she breaks up with him when he gets drunk and embarasses her. When she thinks that she ate Fry (thinking that he fell into a sausage grinder), she goes to get all her memories of Fry erased. During Fry and herself's time without each other they think that they are missing something. Later on, Fry and Leela fight one another, neither remembering the other. When they both see each other's hair, they feel a strong sense of deja vu and on instinct, passionately kiss. They regain their memories and get back together as they enjoy having Oktoberfest, with Leela embarassing Fry by doing the Chicken Dance.\n\nIn &quot;[[Free Will Hunting]]&quot;, Leela is seen in bed with Fry trying to get his mind off of Bender. When Bender returns, Fry asks Bender to come back later but Fry and Leela have no choice but to help with Bender's free will hunt.\n*This is the first time in the series that Fry and Leela are shown having sex in their own bodies.\n\n[[Nibbler]] identifies Leela as &quot;the Other&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Why of Fry]]&lt;/ref&gt; referencing some yet unexplored aspect of Fry's prophesied destiny.\n\nFry finally works up the courage to propose again to Leela in &quot;[[Meanwhile]]&quot;, but becomes despondent and jumps off the building when she does not show well past the time of their dinner. As he is falling, he sees Leela arriving and realizes that the [[Time Button]] he has been using has made his watch run faster than the rest of the universe.\n\nAt first, he tries to save himself by using the Time Button to bring him back to before he jumped, but as it only operates for ten seconds at a time and has to recharge, it brought him back to a point where he was already falling. Eventually, he falls asleep and dies when he hits the ground. Leela then uses the Time Button to bring Fry back and he is able to tell her he loves her, ten seconds at a time.\n\nLeela is moved by this and is able to find a way to save him, but when the Time Button is broken, they find themselves in a world where everything and everyone is frozen. They conduct their own marriage ceremony and spend decades traveling the world. After the [[Professor]] finds them, having spent the time since Fry's rescue looking for them while in a slightly different dimension, he repairs and modifies the device to return them to before he invented it. Fry and Leela choose to return with him and live their life over again.\n\n== References ==\n{{References}}"
